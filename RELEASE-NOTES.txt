                           Commons Configuration Package
                               Version 1.7
                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Configuration component, and highlights changes since the previous version.
The Commons Configuration software library provides a generic configuration
interface which enables an application to read configuration data from a variety
of sources.

It has been a while since the last release, therefore numerous bug fixes have
accumulated. Most of them are not critical, but make the library more stable
and consistent.

There are also some new features, e.g. multi-tenant configurations, or
improvements of DefaultConfigurationBuilder. With the new support for file
systems a major weakness of earlier versions of Commons Configuration has been
addressed: the algorithm for locating configuration files.

Commons Configuration 1.7 is fully binary compatible to the previous version.
Support for Java 1.3 has been dropped, a minimum of Java 1.4 is now
required. There is one exception, however: Commons Configuration 1.7 supports
optionally loading configuration files through Commons VFS
(http://commons.apache.org/vfs/). VFS requires Java 1.5+, so if this feature is
going to be used, a minimum JDK version of 1.5 is needed. More information
about optional dependencies required by specific components of Commons
Configuration can be found at
http://commons.apache.org/configuration/dependencies.html.

Following is a complete list of all changes in the new 1.7 release:

BUG FIXES IN 1.7
================
* [CONFIGURATION-460]
  Reloading now also works for configuration sources declared in the additional
  section of a configuration definition file for DefaultConfigurationBuilder.

* [CONFIGURATION-445]
  Transforming a CombinedConfiguration with ViewNodes to an XMLConfiguration
  could cause problems with attributes. This has been fixed.

* [CONFIGURATION-434]
  HierarchicalINIConfiguration now recognizes comment characters in property
  definitions only if they are preceded by whitespace. Thus comment characters
  can now be part of the property value. This is for instance required for the
  definition of file paths which use the semicolon as path separator.

* [CONFIGURATION-433]
  Minor improvements of the support for indexed properties in
  ConfigurationDynaBean.

* [CONFIGURATION-432]
  The methods getList() and getStringArray() of AbstractConfiguration can now
  handle single-valued properties of primitive types.

* [CONFIGURATION-428]
  XMLConfiguration no longer escapes backslashs in the values of XML elements.

* [CONFIGURATION-424]
  HierarchicalINIConfiguration now works correctly with configurations that
  contain only properties in the global section.

* [CONFIGURATION-423]
  testFromClassPath() can fail when it should not because of inconsistent
  escaping of output from PropertiesConfiguration.getURL() and
  FileChangedReloadingStrategy.getFile().toURL().

* [CONFIGURATION-418]
  A bug related to the interpretation of escape sequences for backslashes has
  been fixed. The user guide has also been improved in this area.

* [CONFIGURATION-415]
  Files with a plus character in their names are now handled correctly.

* [CONFIGURATION-413]
  SubsetConfiguration now produces correct events.

* [CONFIGURATION-409]
  HierarchicalINIConfiguration now correctly saves sections whose name contains
  delimiter characters.

* [CONFIGURATION-407]
  Fixed a potential IllegalStateException in HierarchicalINIConfiguration that
  can be thrown when the global section is requested concurrently.

* [CONFIGURATION-405]
  XMLPropertyListConfiguration no longer throws a ConfigurationException if the
  file to be loaded does not have an outer dict element.

* [CONFIGURATION-404]
  The default expression engine used by hierarchical configurations used to
  throw a NumberFormatException if invalid indices were used in property keys.
  This has been fixed. As a side effect brackets can now be used in property
  keys.

* [CONFIGURATION-403]
  When an empty XMLConfiguration was saved and reloaded the root element was
  assigned an empty text value. Because of this isEmpty() returned false for this
  configuration. This has been fixed.

* [CONFIGURATION-397]
  Schema violation exceptions are now propagated back to the caller.

* [CONFIGURATION-390]
  XMLConfiguration and CombinedConfiguraton are now synchronized to fix problems
  caused by reloading in a multithreaded environment.

* [CONFIGURATION-396]
  HierarchicalConfiguration.NodeVisitor is now passed the correct key to its
  visitAfterChildren() method.

* [CONFIGURATION-393]
  BaseConfiguration.clone() now also clones collections stored in the internal
  map. This causes list properties to be handled correctly.

* [CONFIGURATION-388]
  Attribute or element values will not be escaped when attribute or element
  splitting are disabled.

* [CONFIGURATION-385]
  DatabaseConfiguration now generates correct events for the clear() and
  clearProperty() methods.

* [CONFIGURATION-369]
  SubsetConfiguration did not use locally registered lookups of its interpolator.

* [CONFIGURATION-368]
  SubnodeConfiguration now fires an event of type EVENT_SUBNODE_CHANGED if a
  structural change of the parent configuration was detected. If the
  SubnodeConfiguration is contained in a CombinedConfiguration, the
  CombinedConfiguration receives this event and can update itself.

* [CONFIGURATION-362]
  Empty dictionaries in a PropertyList configuration are now preserved when the
  configuration is saved.

* [CONFIGURATION-361]
  MultiFileHierarchicalConfiguration was not using basepath to construct the
  file url. It also threw an exception if the file pattern resolved to a
  non-existent file. This is now configurable.

* [CONFIGURATION-359]
  Fixed broken links to the API documentation in the user's guide.

* [CONFIGURATION-357]
  The message of the ConversionException thrown by
  AbstractConfiguration.getBigInteger() is now correct.

IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES IN 1.7
====================================
* [CONFIGURATION-458]
  HierarchicalConfiguration now provides a specific implementation of the
  clear() method. This is more efficient and also solves some other problems
  related to clearing a SubnodeConfiguration.

* [CONFIGURATION-455]
  HierarchicalINIConfiguration.getSection() now creates a section if it does not
  exist. The SubnodeConfiguration returned by this method is now always
  connected to the parent ini configuration.

* [CONFIGURATION-452]
  XPathExpressionEngine now provides better support for the setProperty() method.

* [CONFIGURATION-448]
  The parsing of ini files has been improved for property definitions containing
  multiple separator characters.

* [CONFIGURATION-447]
  DefaultConfigurationBuilder now supports including environment properties
  using the "env" tag.

* [CONFIGURATION-446]
  XMLConfiguration now handles attributes correctly whose value is an empty
  string.

* [CONFIGURATION-439]
  Child configuration builders created for a <configuration> element in a
  configuration definition file now inherit the configuration and error
  listeners from the original DefaultConfigurationBuilder. This makes it
  possible to suppress log output created for optional configurations.

* [CONFIGURATION-438]
  JNDIConfiguration.getKeys() no more logs an exception if the prefix does not
  exist.

* [CONFIGURATION-437]
  Child configuration builders created for a <configuration> element in a
  configuration definition file now inherit some of their properties from the
  builder object which processed the file.

* [CONFIGURATION-412]
  DatabaseConfiguration can now be instructed to perform a commit after an
  update of the managed database table. This makes it usable in environments
  where the connections do not use auto-commit mode.

* [CONFIGURATION-410]
  Added a refresh() method to AbstractFileConfiguration and
  AbstractHierarchicalFileConfiguration.

* [CONFIGURATION-399]
  Default variable interpolation now supports the env: prefix for referencing
  environment variables.

* [CONFIGURATION-389]
  DefaultConfigurationBuilder now supports defining ini files in its
  configuration definition file.

* [CONFIGURATION-380]
  Add ExprLookup to allow expressions to be evaluated in configurations. When
  used, this requires that Apache Commons Jexl be added as a dependency to
  projects using Commons Configuration.

* [CONFIGURATION-378]
  Added MergeCombiner to allow elements in two configurations to be merged when
  the element and attributes in the first file match those in the second file.

* [CONFIGURATION-375, CONFIGURATION-376, CONFIGURATION-377]
  Align interpolation functionality of SubnodeConfiguration and
  SubsetConfiguration. SubsetConfiguration will now also interpolate keys of the
  parent configuration or use the local lookups of its parent.
  SubnodeConfiguration is in turn now able to lookup local keys as well.

* [CONFIGURATION-374]
  MapConfiguration now provides a way of controlling the trimming behavior.

* [CONFIGURATION-371]
  PropertiesConfigurationLayout now also stores the property separators used for
  the single properties. It is also possible to change them for specific
  properties or set a global properties separator. In earlier versions the
  separator was hard-coded to " = ".

* [CONFIGURATION-370]
  PropertiesConfiguration now defines a nested interface IOFactory. Using this
  interface it is possible to inject custom PropertiesReader and
  PropertiesWriter implementations.

* [CONFIGURATION-363]
  When using Commons Lang 2.6 or higher as dependency nested interpolation in
  variable names is supported.

* [CONFIGURATION-356]
  Added getConfigurations and getConfigurationNameList.

* [CONFIGURATION-340]
  File system access has been abstracted to a FileSystem interface. Two
  implementations are provided, DefaultFileSystem that behaves in a backward
  compatible manner and VFSFileSystem which uses Commons VFS to retreive and
  store files.

* [CONFIGURATION-314]
  PropertiesConfigurationLayout now allows setting the line separator to be used
  when writing the properties file.

* [CONFIGURATION-257, CONFIGURATION-355]
  Allow configurations to be validated using XML Schemas.

OTHER CHANGES
=============
* [CONFIGURATION-459]
  ConfigurationFactory has been deprecated. The user guide was updated to no
  more mention this class.

* [CONFIGURATION-456]
  Improved Javadocs of getKeys(String) method for some configuration classes.

* [CONFIGURATION-436]
  The optional dependency to Apache Ant has been changed to the new groupId
  org.apache.ant. The version was updated to the most recent version 1.8.2
  (older versions should still work).

* [CONFIGURATION-408]
  PropertiesConfiguration.save() escaped slashes in properties values. This was
  caused by a bug in commons-lang 2.4. Updating to a newer version of commons-lang
  fixed this problem.

* [CONFIGURATION-358]
  Improvements of the user's guide for hierarchical configurations.

* Dependencies to some other Commons components have been updated to use the
  most recent version. However, as none of the new features are used, the old
  versions will still work.
