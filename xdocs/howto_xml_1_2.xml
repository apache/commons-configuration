	<section name="Hierarchical properties">
		<p>
			Because of its
			tree-like nature XML documents can represent data that is
			structured in many ways. This section explains how to deal with
			such structured documents and demonstrates the enhanced query
            facilities supported by the <code>XMLConfiguration</code> class..
		</p>
        <subsection name="Accessing properties defined in XML documents">
            <p>
                We will start with a simple XML document to show some basics
                about accessing properties. The following file named
                <code>gui.xml</code> is used as example document:
            </p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<gui-definition>
  <colors>
    <background>#808080</background>
    <text>#000000</text>
    <header>#008000</header>
    <link normal="#000080" visited="#800080"/>
    <default>${colors.header}</default>
  </colors>
  <rowsPerPage>15</rowsPerPage>
  <buttons>
    <name>OK,Cancel,Help</name>
  </buttons>
  <numberFormat pattern="###\,###.##"/>
</gui-definition>
]]></source>
			<p>
				(As becomes obvious, this tutorial does not bother with good
				design of XML documents, the example file should rather 
				demonstrate the different ways of accessing properties.)
				To access the data stored in this document it must be loaded
                by <code>XMLConfiguration</code>. Like other file based
                configuration classes <code>XMLConfiguration</code> supports
                many ways of specifying the file to process. One way is to
                pass the file name to the constructor as shown in the following
                code fragment:
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
try
{
    XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration("tables.xml");
    // do something with config
}
catch(ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // something went wrong, e.g. the file was not found
}
]]></source>
			<p>
				If no exception was thrown, the properties defined in the
                XML document are now available in the configuration object.
                The following fragment shows how the properties can be accessed:
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
String backColor = config.getString("colors.background");
String textColor = config.getString("colors.text");
String linkNormal = config.getString("colors.link[@normal]");
String defColor = config.getString("colors.default");
int rowsPerPage = config.getInt("rowsPerPage");
List buttons = config.getList("buttons.name");
]]></source>
			<p>
				This listing demonstrates some important points about constructing
				keys for accessing properties load from XML documents and about
                features of <code>XMLConfiguration</code> in general:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Nested elements are accessed using a dot notation. In
						the example document there is an element
						<code>&lt;text&gt;</code> in the body of the
						<code>&lt;color&gt;</code> element. The corresponding
						key is <code>color.text</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						The root element is ignored when constructing keys. In
						the example you do not write
						<code>gui-definition.color.text</code>, but only
						<code>color.text</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Attributes of XML elements are accessed in a XPath like
						notation.
					</li>
                    <li>
                        Interpolation can be used as in <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code>.
                        Here the <code>&lt;default&gt;</code> element in the
                        <code>colors</code> section refers to another color.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lists of properties can be defined in a short form using
                        the delimiter character (which is the comma by default).
                        In this example the <code>buttons.name</code> property
                        has the three values <em>OK</em>, <em>Cancel</em>, and
                        <em>Help</em>, so it is queried using the <code>getList()</code>
                        method. This works in attributes, too. Using the static
                        <code>setDelimiter()</code> method of
                        <code>AbstractConfiguration</code> you can globally
                        define a different delimiter character or -
                        by setting the delimiter to 0 - disabling this mechanism
                        completely. Placing a backslash before a delimiter
                        character will escape it. This is demonstrated in the
                        <code>pattern</code> attribute of the <code>numberFormat</code>
                        element.
                    </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
            <p>
                In the next section will show how data in a more complex XML
                document can be processed.

				Consider the following scenario: An application operates on
				database tables and wants to load a definition of the database
				schema from its configuration. A XML document provides this
				information. It could look as follows:
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[

    </table>
  </tables>
</database>
]]></source>
			<p>
				This XML is quite self explanatory; there is an arbitrary number
				of table elements, each of it has a name and a list of fields.
				A field in turn consists of a name and a data type. This
                XML document (let's call it <code>tables.xml</code>) can be
                loaded in exactly the same way as the simple document in the
                section before.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we now want to access some of the properties we face a
                problem: the syntax for	constructing configuration keys we
                learned so far is not powerful enough to access all of the data
                stored in the tables document.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because the document contains a list of tables some properties
				are defined more than once. E.g. the configuration key
				<code>tables.table.name</code> refers to a <code>name</code>
				element inside a <code>table</code> element inside a
				<code>tables</code> element. This constellation happens to
				occur twice in the tables document.
			</p>
			<p>
				Multiple definitions of a property do not cause problems and are
				supported by all classes of Configuration. If such a property
				is queried using <code>getProperty()</code>, the method
				recognizes that there are multiple values for that property and
				returns a collection with all these values. So we could write
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
Object prop = config.getProperty("tables.table.name");
if(prop instanceof Collection)
{
	System.out.println("Number of tables: " + ((Collection) prop).size());
}
]]></source>
			<p>
				An alternative to this code would be the <code>getList()</code>
				method of <code>Configuration</code>. If a property is known to
				have multiple values (as is the table name property in this example),
				<code>getList()</code> allows to retrieve all values at once.
				<b>Note:</b> it is legal to call <code>getString()</code>
				or one of the other getter methods on a property with multiple
				values; it returns the first element of the list.
			</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Accessing structured properties">
			<p>
				Okay, we can obtain a list with the name of all defined
				tables. In the same way we can retrieve a list with the names
				of all table fields: just pass the key
				<code>tables.table.fields.field.name</code> to the
				<code>getList()</code> method. In our example this list
				would contain 10 elements, the names of all fields of all tables.
				This is fine, but how do we know, which field belongs to
				which table?
			</p>
			<p>
				When working with such hierarchical structures the configuration keys
				used to query properties can have an extended syntax. All components
				of a key can be appended by a numerical value in parentheses that
				determines the index of the affected property. So if we have two
				<code>table</code> elements we can exactly specify, which one we
				want to address by appending the corresponding index. This is
				explained best by some examples:
			</p>
			<p>
				We will now provide some configuration keys and show the results
				of a <code>getProperty()</code> call with these keys as arguments.
				<dl>
					<dt><code>tables.table(0).name</code></dt>
					<dd>
						Returns the name of the first table (all indices are 0 based),
						in this example the string <em>users</em>.
					</dd>
					<dt><code>tables.table(0)[@tableType]</code></dt>
					<dd>
						Returns the value of the tableType attribute of the first
						table (<em>system</em>).
					</dd>
					<dt><code>tables.table(1).name</code></dt>
					<dd>
						Analogous to the first example returns the name of the
						second table (<em>documents</em>).
					</dd>
					<dt><code>tables.table(2).name</code></dt>
					<dd>
						Here the name of a third table is queried, but because there
						are only two tables result is <b>null</b>. The fact that a
						<b>null</b> value is returned for invalid indices can be used
						to find out how many values are defined for a certain property:
						just increment the index in a loop as long as valid objects
						are returned.
					</dd>
					<dt><code>tables.table(1).fields.field.name</code></dt>
					<dd>
						Returns a collection with the names of all fields that
						belong to the second table. With such kind of keys it is
						now possible to find out, which fields belong to which table.
					</dd>
					<dt><code>tables.table(1).fields.field(2).name</code></dt>
					<dd>
						The additional index after field selects a certain field.
						This expression represents the name of the third field in
						the second table (<em>creationDate</em>).
					</dd>
					<dt><code>tables.table.fields.field(0).type</code></dt>
					<dd>
						This key may be a bit unusual but nevertheless completely
						valid. It selects the data types of the first fields in all
						tables. So here a collection would be returned with the
						values [<em>long, long</em>].
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</p>
			<p>
				These examples should make the usage of indices quite clear.
				Because each configuration key can contain an arbitrary number
				of indices it is possible to navigate through complex structures of
				XML documents; each XML element can be uniquely identified.
			</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Adding new properties">
			<p>
				So far we have learned how to use indices to avoid ambiguities when
				querying properties. The same problem occurs when adding new
				properties to a structured configuration. As an example let's
				assume we want to add a new field to the second table. New properties
				can be added to a configuration using the <code>addProperty()</code>
				method. Of course, we have to exactly specify where in the tree like structure new
				data is to be inserted. A statement like
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
// Warning: This might cause trouble!
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field.name", "size");
]]></source>
			<p>
				would not be sufficient because it does not contain all needed
				information. How is such a statement processed by the
				<code>addProperty()</code> method?
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>addProperty()</code> splits the provided key into its
				single parts and navigates through the properties tree along the
				corresponding element names. In this example it will start at the
				root element and then find the <code>tables</code> element. The
				next key part to be processed is <code>table</code>, but here a
				problem occurs: the configuration contains two <code>table</code>
				properties below the <code>tables</code> element. To get rid off
				this ambiguity an index can be specified at this position in the
				key that makes clear, which of the two properties should be
				followed. <code>tables.table(1).fields.field.name</code> e.g.
				would select the second <code>table</code> property. If an index
				is missing, <code>addProperty()</code> always follows the last
				available element. In our example this would be the second
				<code>table</code>, too.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following parts of the key are processed in exactly the same
				manner. Under the selected <code>table</code> property there is
				exactly one <code>fields</code> property, so this step is not
				problematic at all. In the next step the <code>field</code> part
				has to be processed. At the actual position in the properties tree
				there are multiple <code>field</code> (sub) properties. So we here
				have the same situation as for the <code>table</code> part.
				Because no explicit index is defined the last <code>field</code>
				property is selected. The last part of the key passed to
				<code>addProperty()</code> (<code>name</code> in this example)
				will always be added as new property at the position that has
				been reached in the former processing steps. So in our example
				the last <code>field</code> property of the second table would
				be given a new <code>name</code> sub property and the resulting
				structure would look like the following listing:
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
	...
    <table tableType="application">
      <name>documents</name>
      <fields>
        <field>
          <name>docid</name>
          <type>long</type>
        </field>
        <field>
          <name>name</name>
          <type>java.lang.String</type>
        </field>
        <field>
          <name>creationDate</name>
          <type>java.util.Date</type>
        </field>
        <field>
          <name>authorID</name>
          <type>long</type>
        </field>
        <field>
          <name>version</name>
		  <name>size</name>    <== Newly added property
          <type>int</type>
        </field>
      </fields>
    </table>
  </tables>
</database>
]]></source>
			<p>
				This result is obviously not what was desired, but it demonstrates
				how <code>addProperty()</code> works: the method follows an
				existing branch in the properties tree and adds new leaves to it.
				(If the passed in key does not match a branch in the existing tree,
				a new branch will be added. E.g. if we pass the key
				<code>tables.table.data.first.test</code>, the existing tree can be
				navigated until the <code>data</code> part of the key. From here a
				new branch is started with the remaining parts <code>data</code>,
				<code>first</code> and <code>test</code>.)
			</p>
			<p>
				If we want a different behavior, we must explicitely tell
				<code>addProperty()</code> what to do. In our example with the
				new field our intension was to create a new branch for the
				<code>field</code> part in the key, so that a new <code>field</code>
				property is added to the structure rather than adding sub properties
				to the last existing <code>field</code> property. This can be
				achieved by specifying the special index <code>(-1)</code> at the
				corresponding position in the key as shown below:
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
config.addProperty("tables.table(1).fields.field(-1).name", "size");
config.addProperty("tables.table(1).fields.field.type", "int");
]]></source>
			<p>
				The first line in this fragment specifies that a new branch is
				to be created for the <code>field</code> property (index -1).
				In the second line no index is specified for the field, so the
				last one is used - which happens to be the field that has just
				been created. So these two statements add a fully defined field
				to the second table. This is the default pattern for adding new
				properties or whole hierarchies of properties: first create a new
				branch in the properties tree and then populate its sub properties.
				As an additional example let's add a complete new table definition
				to our example configuration:
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
// Add a new table element and define the name
config.addProperty("tables.table(-1).name", "versions");

// Add a new field to the new table
// (an index for the table is not necessary because the latest is used)
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field(-1).name", "id");
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field.type", "int");

// Add another field to the new table
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field(-1).name", "date");
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field.type", "java.sql.Date");
...
]]></source>
			<p>
				For more information about adding properties to a hierarchical
				configuration also have a look at the javadocs for
				<code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code>.

		<subsection name="Escaping dot characters in XML tags">
			<p>
                In XML the dot character used as delimiter by most configuration
                classes is a legal character that can occur in any tag. So the
                following XML document is completely valid:
			</p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <test.value>42</test.value>
  <test.complex>
    <test.sub.element>many dots</test.sub.element>
  </test.complex>
</configuration>
]]></source>
			<p>
                This XML document can be loaded by <code>XMLConfiguration</code>
                without trouble, but when we want to access certain properties
                we face a problem: The configuration claims that it does not
                store any values for the properties with the keys
                <code>test.value</code> or <code>test.complex.test.sub.element</code>!
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, it is the dot character contained in the property
                names, which causes this problem. A dot is always interpreted
                as a delimiter between elements. So given the property key
                <code>test.value</code> the configuration would look for an
                element named <code>test</code> and then for a sub element
                with the name <code>value</code>. To change this behavior it is
                possible to escape a dot character, thus telling the configuration
                that it is really part of an element name. This is simply done
                by duplicating the dot. So the following statements will return
                the desired property values:
            </p>
   			<source><![CDATA[
int testVal = config.getInt("test..value");
String complex = config.getString("test..complex.test..sub..element");
]]></source>
            <p>
                Note the duplicated dots whereever the dot does not act as
                delimiter. This way it is possible to access properties containing
                dots in arbitrary combination. However, as you can see, the
                escaping can be confusing sometimes. So if you have a choice,
                you should avoid dots in the tag names of your XML configuration
                files.
            </p>
        </subsection>
	</section>
    
    <section name="Validation of XML configuration files">
        <p>
            XML parsers provide support for validation of XML documents to ensure that they
            conform to a certain DTD. This feature can be useful for
            configuration files, too. <code>XMLConfiguration</code> allows to enable
            validation for the files to load.
        </p>
        <p>
            The easiest way to turn on validation is to simply set the
            <code>validating</code> property to true as shown in the
            following example:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
XMLConfiguration config = new XMLConfiguration();
config.setFileName("myconfig.xml");
config.setValidating(true);

// This will throw a ConfigurationException if the XML document does not
// conform to its DTD.
config.load();
]]></source>
        <p>
            Setting the <code>validating</code> flag to true will cause
            <code>XMLConfiguration</code> to use a validating XML parser. At this parser
            a custom <code>ErrorHandler</code> will be registered, which throws
            exceptions on simple and fatal parsing errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            While using the <code>validating</code> flag is a simple means of
            enabling validation it cannot fullfil more complex requirements,
            e.g. schema validation. To be able to deal with such requirements
            XMLConfiguration provides a generic way of setting up the XML
            parser to use: A preconfigured <code>DocumentBuilder</code> object
            can be passed to the <code>setDocumentBuilder()</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
            So an application can create a <code>DocumentBuilder</code> object
            and initialize it according to its special needs. Then this
            object must be passed to the <code>XMLConfiguration</code> instance
