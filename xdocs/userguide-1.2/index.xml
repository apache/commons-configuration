      <p>
        Here you can find documents that describe the usage of some of
        the main classes provided by the Commons Configuration project. Prior
        to the 1.3 release these howto documents made up the user
        documentation. In Commons Configuration 1.3 they have been replaced by
        a new <a href="../user_guide.html">user's guide</a>. So if you are using
        a newer version of Commons Configuration you should jump to this new
        user's guide. For versions up to 1.2 you are right here.
