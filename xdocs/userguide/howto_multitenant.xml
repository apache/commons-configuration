    <section name="Multi-tenant Configurations">
      <p>
        In a multi-tenant environment a single instance of the application
        while run on behalf of many clients. Typically, this will require
        that each client have its own unique configuration. The simplest
        approach to enable an application to be multi-tenant is for it
        to not really be aware of it at all. This requires that the
        configuration framework take on some of the responsility for
        making the application work correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        One approach to enable this support in a web application might be
        to use a Servlet Filter and then use the Log4j or SLF4J MDC to
        save the attributes needed to identify the client. These attributes
        can then be used to identify the specific client configuration to
        be used. The classes described below use this technique to allow
        configurations to transparently provide the configuration appropriate
        for the clients.
      </p>

      <subsection name="MultiFileHierarchicalConfiguration">
        <p>
          The constructor for this class accepts a pattern. The pattern can
          contain keys that will be resolved using the ConfigurationInterpolator
          on each call to a method in the class. The configuration file will then
          be located using the resolved pattern and a new XMLConfiguration
          will be created and cached for subsequent requests. The ExpressionEngine,
          ReloadingStrategy and listeners will be propogated to each of the
          created configurations.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="DynamicCombinedConfiguration">
        <p>
          The CombinedConfiguration class allows multiple configuration files to be
          merged together. However, it will not merge a MultiFileHierarchicalConfiguration
          properly since the underlying configuration file will be different depending
          on the resolution of the location pattern. DynamicCombinedConfiguration
          solves this by creating a new CombinedConfiguration for each pattern.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Sample Configuration">
        <p>
           This sample configuration illustrates how to use DynamicCombinedConfiguration
           in combination with MultiFileHierarchicalConfiguration to create a multi-tenant
           configuration.

      <subsection name="PatternSubtreeConfigurationWrapper">
        <p>
          Applications are often composed of many components each of which need their
          own configuration. This can be accomodated by having a configuration file
          per component, but this can make things hard to manage when there are many
          clients and many components. A second approach is to combine them into
          a single configuration file. However, this either means the subcomponent
          has to be aware of the surrounding configuration and navigate past it or the
          application must be provided just the portion of the configuration it
          can process. PatternSubtreeConfigurationWrapper can be used for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normal practice when using dependency injection frameworks is to have the
          attributes needed to make components work correctly injected into them.
          When working with Commons Configuration this works very well. Components
          simply need to have a HierarchicalConfiguration attribute along with
          a corresponding setter and getter. The injection framework can then be
          used to provide the component with the correct configuration using
          PatternSubtreeConfigurationWrapper as shown in the next example.
