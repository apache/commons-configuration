    <release version="1.4-SNAPSHOT" date="in SVN">
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-255">
        DatabaseConfiguration now handles list delimiters in property values
        correctly.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-254" due-to="Carsten Kaiser">
        After cloning a XMLConfiguration there was still a connection to the
        original configuration. So when the clone was modified and then saved
        the content of the original configuration was written. This has now
        been fixed.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update">
        Class loading in BeanHelper is now done using ClassUtils of Commons
        Lang.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-237" due-to="Nicolas de Loof">
        With ManagedReloadingStrategy a new reloading strategy for file-based
        configurations was added that can be triggered through JMX.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update">
        The dependencies to Commons Lang, Commons Collections, and Commons Digester
        are updated to use the recent available version. However older versions
        will still work.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add">
        A pom for maven 2 was added.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-252">
        ConfigurationUtils.getFile() now always checks first whether the passed
        in file name is absolute. If it is, this file will be returned. This
        prevents that on Unix under certain circumstances absolute file names
        are interpreted as relative ones.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-251">
        The dependency to xml-apis was changed to the version 1.0.b2. The so
        far used version 2.0.2 is reported to be bogus.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-245">
        In addition to configuration event listeners now so-called configuration
        error listeners are supported. These listeners are notified about
        internal errors that had been logged and swallowed by privious versions.
        The new enableRuntimeExceptions() method of ConfigurationUtils
        registers a special error listener at the passed in configuration that
        generates a runtime exception when an error event is received.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add">
        AbstractConfiguration now allows to set an instance specific logger
        using the setLogger() method. This gives clients more control over a
        configuration's logging behavior.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-155">
        SubsetConfiguration and CompositeConfiguration were updated to fully
        support an instance specific list delimiter. Concerning splitting of
        string properties that contain a list delimiter character, these
        classes now behave like a "normal" configuration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-192">
        Variable interpolation features have been improved. A variable can now
        have the form <code>${prefix:variableName}</code> where the prefix
        defines the type of the variable. The standard types <em>sys</em> for
        system properties and <em>const</em> for constants are supported.
        Variables without a prefix are treated as references to other
        configuration properties (which is compatible to earlier versions).
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update">
        Commons Configuration now depends on Commons Lang 2.2. Some features
        of Lang's new text package are used.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-244">
        The number of dependencies needed for DefaultConfigurationBuilder was
        reduced by letting some of the default configuration providers resolve
        their classes per reflection.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-240">
        File-based configurations with a reloading strategy did not work well
        together with CombinedConfiguration because the reloading strategy is
        only checked when its associated configuration is accessed (which does
        not happen when only the combined configuration is queried).
        As a workaround CombinedConfiguration now provides the boolean
        forceReloadCheck property. If this is set to true, all contained
        configurations will be triggered when a property is queried. This will
        cause a reload if necessary.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-243">
        Configuration declarations in the configuration definition file for
        DefaultConfigurationBuilder that are marked as optional now support a
        new attribute <code>config-forceCreate</code>. If this attribute is set
        to true and the initialization of the configuration fails,
        DefaultConfigurationBuilder tries to add an empty configuration of the
        correct type to the resulting combined configuration. Before this
        change optional configurations that caused errors were never added to
        the combined configuration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-241">
        CompositeConfiguration.clearProperty() now generates the correct
        update events.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-242">
        The configuration returned by HierarchicalConfiguration.subset()
        performed variable interpolation only in the keys that belong to the
        subset. Now the parent configuration is searched, too, to resolve the
        value of the referenced property. This is consistent with the way
        SubnodeConfiguration works.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-234">
        DefaultConfigurationBuilder now internally uses the standard expression
        engine for hierarchical configurations. So the dependency to Commons
        JXPath is no more needed when this class is used. Note that this change
        has some impact on existing code that manually sets properties before
        the combined configuration is created; this code must now be adapted to
        the changed syntax of property keys.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-236">
        HierarchicalConfiguration and some of its sub classes now define a
        copy constructor.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-197" due-to="Trevor Charles Miller">
        A new configuration class for windows ini files was added.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-229">
        For file-based configurations loaded by ConfigurationFactory the load()
        method was called before all of the properties specified by attributes
        of the XML element have been initialized. Now load() is called after
        property initialization.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-235">
        Interpolation of non string values did not work when SubsetConfiguration
        was involved. This has now been fixed.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-227">
        The compatibility of ConfigurationDynaBean with other configuration types
        than those that inherit from BaseConfiguration was improved.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-233" due-to="Rainer Jung">
        The getList() method of CompositeConfiguration does now fully support
        variable interpolation. So it is possible to refer to a variable in
        one (sub) configuration that is defined in another configuration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-230">
        XPathExpressionEngine used to create wrong keys for attribute nodes.
        This caused some operations on XMLConfiguration to fail when such an
        expression engine was set (e.g. reloading). Now correct keys for
        attributes are constructed.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-228">
        Some of the methods of file-based hierarchical configurations (e.g.
        subset() or configurationAt()) did not take an eventually set reloading
        strategy into account. This is now fixed by overriding the internal
        fetchNodeList() method in AbstractHierarchicalFileConfiguration and
        letting it always check for a reload.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="1.3" date="2006-09-24">
    </release>

    <release version="1.3-rc2" date="2006-09-03">
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-223" due-to="Gabriele Garuglieri">
        AbstractFileConfiguration now overrides addProperty() and setProperty()
        instead of addPropertyDirect() to implement the auto save feature.
        This was necessary to properly integrate PropertiesConfigurationLayout.
        It has also the advantage that an auto save is triggered only once if
        multi-valued properties are involved (before a save operation was
        performed for each property value).
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-222" due-to="Gabriele Garuglieri">
        The new PropertiesConfigurationLayout class broke the save() operation
        of PropertiesConfiguration when an instance was newly created and
        populated in memory. This is fixed now by ensuring that a layout object
        is immediately created and registered as event listener at the
        configuration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-221" due-to="Rainer Jung">
        ConfigurationFactory now supports variables in its configuration
        definition files. These variables are resolved using system properties
        and have the typical ${} syntax.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-216" due-to="Gabriele Garuglieri">
        There were still some problems with resolving relative paths when
        configuration files are loaded from classpath. This fix addresses these
        issues.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-220">
        DataConfiguration.getDateArray() used to ignore the format argument.
        This was fixed.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-219">
        PropertiesConfiguration now defines its own clone() method to handle
        the associated PropertiesConfigurationLayout object correctly.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.3-rc1" date="2006-07-30">
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-217">
        The dependency to servletapi was updated from version 2.3 to version
        2.4, but version 2.3 will still work.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-104">
        A new class PropertiesConfigurationLayout was introduced whose task is
        to preserve the structure (e.g. comments, blanc lines) of a file
        loaded by PropertiesConfiguration. Each PropertiesConfiguration
        object is now associated with such a layout object. A saved properties
        file will look very similar to its original.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-145">
        clone() methods have been added to BaseConfiguration, AbstractFileConfiguration,
        MapConfiguration, CompositeConfiguration, and CombinedConfiguration.
        So the most important Configuration implementations now support
        cloning. To ConfigurationUtils an utility method cloneConfiguration()
        was added that allows to conveniently clone a configuration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-216">
        If a configuration file was to be loaded from classpath, the
        constructor of AbstractFileConfiguration dropped the file's path. The
        path is now taken into account.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-214">
        The getter methods for numeric data types in AbstractConfiguration now
        support conversions between different Number types, e.g. you can now
        call getLong(key) when key points to an Integer value.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add">
        The new class DefaultConfigurationBuilder was added as an alternative to
        ConfigurationFactory. It provides some more features and creates a
        CombinedConfiguration object
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add">
        The new class CombinedConfiguration was added as a hierarchical
        alternative to CompositeConfiguration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-143">
        Support for low-level configuration events was added to all classes
        derived from AbstractConfiguration. The major part of this is handled
        by the new super class EventSource of AbstractConfiguration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add">
        A new method convertToHierarchical() was added to ConfigurationUtils,
        which is able to convert an arbitrary configuration object into a
        hierarchical configuration.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-63">
        Loading of file-based configurations no longer throws a NullPointerException
        in setups where the thread context class loader is not set. 
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update">
        The dependency to dom4j was removed; it was only used by two test classes,
        which have been re-written.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-100">
        XMLConfiguration used to drop the DOCTYPE declaration when saving the
        configuration. It is now able to extract the DTD's public and system ID
        and write them back (more complex DOCTYPE declarations are still not supported).
        With the new methods setSystemID() and setPublicID(), the DOCTYPE
        declaration can be configured.
      </action>
      <action dev="ebourg" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-178">
        Added two new constructors in CompositeConfiguration accepting a
        collection of configurations as a parameter.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-186">
        (Basic) Support for declaring beans in configuration files was added.
        Some new classes in the beanutils package allow to create instances from
        these declarations.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update">
        The implementation of the interpolation features have been extracted out
        off AbstractConfiguration and moved to PropertyConverter. The
        interpolateHelper() method of AbstractConfiguration is now deprectated
        and will not be called any more during interpolation.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-182">
        A new method configurationsAt() was added to HierarchicalConfiguration
        that provides a convenient way of iterating over complex list-like
        structures without the need of manually constructing configuration keys
        with indices.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add">
        A new class SubnodeConfiguration was introduced that wraps a configuration
        node of a HierarchicalConfiguration. All operations performed on this
        configuration use this wrapped node as root. The new configurationAt()
        method of HierarchicalConfiguration returns such a SubnodeConfiguration
        for a specified sub node.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-173">
        With XPathExpressionEngine an expression engine for hierarchical
        configurations is now available that can evaluate XPATH expressions in
        property keys. This expression engine implementation is based on
        Commons JXPath, which is now declared as a new dependency (but at
        runtime it is only needed if the XPathExpressionEngine class is used).
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add">
        The code for interpreting property keys was refactored out off
        HierarchicalConfiguration. Instead this class now supports pluggable
        expression engines (using the setExpressionEngine() method). So it is
        possible to plug in different expression languages. A default expression
        engine is provided that understands the native expression language used
        by hierarchical configurations in older versions. During the process of
        this refactoring some methods of HierarchicalConfiguration have been
        deprecated; they will not be called any more when searching or adding
        properties. These are the following: createAddPath(), fetchAddNode(),
        findLastPathNode(), findPropertyNodes().
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update">
        A larger refactoring was performed on the inner Node class of
        HierarchicalConfiguration: A ConfigurationNode interface was extracted
        for which a default implementation (DefaultConfigurationNode) is
        provided. HierarchicalConfiguration.Node now extends this default
        implementation. The new ConfigurationNode interface defines some more
        methods than the Node class did originally for conveniently dealing with
        sub nodes and attributes. HierarchicalConfiguration now uses the new
        type ConfigurationNode whereever possible. Some methods dealing with
        Node objects have been deprecated and replaced by versions operating on
        ConfigurationNode objects instead.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="update" issue="CONFIGURATION-155" due-to="Jorge Ferrer">
        All configuration classes derived from AbstractConfiguration now allow
        to set an instance specific list delimiter. This can be done through
        the new method setListDelimiter(). As before it is possible to define
        a default list delimiter, which will be used if no instance specific
        delimiter is set. This can be done using the new setDefaultListDelimiter()
        method (the methods get/setDelimiter() have been deprecated). With the
        new setDelimiterParsingDisabled() method parsing of lists can be
        disabled at all.

        Changed CompositeConfiguration to extend from AbstractConfiuration. This means that the behavior of
        CompositeConfiguration is much similar to others like PropertiesConfiguration in handling of missing

        Removed "defaults" from BaseConfiguration. Defaults are now done via using a CompositeConfiguration, either
        directly or via a ConfigurationFactory. if you want to save changes made to a Configuration, then you use
        a CompositeConfiguration and get back the inMemoryConfiguration that has the delta of changes. Added a
        bit of documentation on this.
