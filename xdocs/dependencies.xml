            <p>
              In the maven POM a lot of dependencies are declared. These are all
              needed during compile time. On runtime however you only need to
              add the dependencies to your classpath that are required by the
              parts of the Commons Configuration package you are using. The
              following table helps you to determine which dependencies you
              have to include based on the components you intend to use:

                <li>Commons Configuration makes use of other
                Commons components. You should be able to use the current
                versions of these components together with Commons Configuration.
                In some cases, when no specific features are used, older
                versions will work, too. Below is a table with the version
                numbers that have been tested:

                  In Java versions before 1.4 XML support is not integrated. To
                  make use of components that require XML processing you need
                  to add a suitable replacement. We used 
                  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces 2.2.1</a>,
                  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Xalan 2.7.0</a>, and
                  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/commons/">XML APIs 2.0.2</a>.
                  Version 2.7.0 of Xalan seems to cause some problems in a few
                  of our JUnit tests (a <code>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError</code>
                  is thrown when a SAX data source is to be transformed into a
                  DOM result). With version 2.6.0 these problems do not occur.
                  In both cases the error happened only in test code; the actual
                  code was not affected. But if you face a similar problem with
                  Xalan 2.7.0 it is worth trying the older version.
