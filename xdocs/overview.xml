    <section name="Using Configuration">
      <p>
        One of the strength of Commons Configuration is its ability to mix configurations
        from heterogeneous sources, this section will introduce you to the different configurations
        available and will show you how to combine them.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Configuration Sources">
      <p>
        Currently there are quite a number of different sources of Configuration objects. But,
        by just using a Configuration object versus a specific type like XMLConfiguration or
        JNDIConfiguration, you are sheltered from the mechanics of actually retrieving the
        configuration values. These various sources include:
        <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>PropertiesConfiguration</strong>
              Loads configuration values from a properties file.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>BaseConfiguration</strong>
              An in-memory method of populating a Configuration object.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>XMLConfiguration</strong>
              Takes values from an XML document.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>JNDIConfiguration</strong>
              Using a key in the JNDI tree, can retrieve values as configuration properties.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>SystemConfiguration</strong>
              A configuration using the system properties
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>ConfigurationConverter</strong>
              Takes a java.util.Properties or an o.a.c.collections.ExtendedProperties
              and converts it to a Configuration object.
          </li>
       </ul>

      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Mixing Configuration Sources">
      <p>
        Often you want to provide a base set of configuration values, but allow the user to easily
        override them for their specific environment.  Well one way is to hard code the default
        values into your code, and have then provide a property file that overrides this.  However,
        this is a very rigid way of doing things. Instead, with the <code>CompositeConfiguration</code>
        you can provide many different ways of setting up a configuration. You can either do it
        manually:
      </p>

<source>
CompositeConfiguration config = new CompositeConfiguration();
config.addConfiguration(new SystemConfiguration());
config.addConfiguration(new PropertiesConfiguration("application.properties"));
</source>

      <p>or via the <code>ConfigurationFactory</code> class:</p>

<source>
ConfigurationFactory factory = new ConfigurationFactory("config.xml");
Configuration config = factory.getConfiguration();
</source>

      <p>
        The <code>config.xml</code> file used in the example above is a configuration descriptor,
        it specifies the Configuration objects to load. Here is an example of descriptor:
      </p>

<source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <system/>
  <properties fileName="application.properties"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>

      <p>
        What this says is that we are loading up all system properties, as well as the properties
        file <code>application.properties</code>. The order of precedence is first to last. So in
        the above example, if a property is not found in the system properties, it'll be searched
        in the properties file. This allows you to set up default values in a properties file, and
        override them with the system properties.
      </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Configuration Details">
      <p>
      Configuration is done by taking the configuration descriptor XML file and parsing the
      individual configurations.  Make sure to include the various <a href="dependencies.html">dependencies</a>
      required for each type of configuration!
      </p>
      <subsection name="Classic Properties File">
<source><![CDATA[
  <properties fileName="conf/test.properties"/>
]]></source>

        <p>
      This configuration file is very simple.  You just need to specify the path to the property file.
      </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="XML Properties File">
        <source><![CDATA[
  <xml fileName="conf/test.xml"/>
]]></source>
        <p>
        The configuration is very similar to the classic properties file.  However, the xml file
        must be in a specific format. Currently there is no DTD.
        </p>
<source><![CDATA[
<baseElement>
  <element>value</element>
  <element2>
    <subelement>
      <subsubelement>I'm complex!</subsubelement>
    </subelement>
  </element2>
  <test>
    <short>8</short>
  </test>
</baseElement>
]]></source>
        <p>
          In the above example, the root element is ignored.  So to get the value "8", you would
          request from your Configuration object the key "<code>test.short</code>". The root
          element can be called anything.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="JNDI Environment Properties">
        <source><![CDATA[
  <jndi prefix="java:comp/env"/>
]]></source>
        <p>
        This configuration is very useful for setting environment specific settings like mail
        servers! The prefix tells the <code>ConfigurationFactory</code> what the root will be
        to look up your configuration settings.
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
    <env-entry>
        <env-entry-name>smtp</env-entry-name>
        <env-entry-value>127.0.0.1</env-entry-value>
        <env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>
    </env-entry>

    <env-entry>
        <env-entry-name>test/short</env-entry-name>
        <env-entry-value>80</env-entry-value>
        <env-entry-type>java.lang.Short</env-entry-type>
    </env-entry>
]]></source>
        <p>
        <strong>Note!</strong>  If you have a property called "<code>test.short</code>" with spaces
        in it, then it will be translated as the key "<code>test/short</code>".  Therefore, you
        should NOT use spaces in the name of properties that are loaded from JNDI!  If you do want
        to use them, then make sure to convert in your <code>web.xml</code> the "." characters to
        "/" characters, like in the <code>test.short</code> example above.
        </p>
