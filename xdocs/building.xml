        <section name="Overview">
          <p>
            Commons Configuration can be built using
            <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven</a> or
            <a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant</a>.

        <section name="Maven 2">
          <p>
            Commons Configuration uses Maven 2 as its build tool. To build the Configuration
            jar, change into the directory where the source distribution resides and run
            "mvn install". This will compile the source and tests, run the tests, and then
            package the jar. The jar will also be copied into the local maven repository
            for use by other builds.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build the web site run "mvn site". When it completes the web site will reside in
            the target/site directory and may be viewed by opening target/site/index.html.
          </p>

        <section name="Running Functional Tests">
          <p>
            <code>TestWebdavConfigurationBuilder</code> is a functional test that tests
            DefaultConfigurationBuilder with the configuration files stored in a WebDAV
            server. To run the test the steps that follow
            <ol>
              <li>Copy all the files in the conf directory to the WebDAV server. Not all the
              files are required but it is generally easier to use a tool like cadaver
              and do an mput than try to copy the required files individually.</li>
              <li>Add the following to the profiles section of settings.xml in the Maven home
              directory. Modify the urls to match your setup.
<source><![CDATA[
   <profile>
    <profile>
      <id>webdav</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <test.webdav.base>webdav://vfsusr:vfstest@192.168.10.133:80/conf</test.webdav.base>
      </properties>
    </profile>]]></source></li>
              <li>run "mvn -P webdav test -Dtest=TestWebdavConfigurationBuilder". The test
              can also be run using "mvn -P webdav test" but this will run all the unit tests
              in addition to the WebDAV test.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Ant Goals">
          <p>
            To build a jar file, change into Configuration's root directory and run "ant jar".
            The result will be in the "target" subdirectory.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build the Javadocs, run "ant javadoc".
            The result will be in "target/docs/apidocs".
