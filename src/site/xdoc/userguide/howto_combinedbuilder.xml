    <section name="Combining Configuration Sources">
    <p>
      While simple applications often store their configuration data in a
      single configuration file, there may be advanced requirements for more
      complex systems. From a certain size of configuration data it surely
      makes sense to divide the settings available on a set of configuration
      files each of which is related to a specific sub-domain. This makes it
      easier for users or administrators to adapt specific configuration
      settings. However, rather than reading multiple files and dealing with
      multiple <code>Configuration</code> objects, an application probably
      prefers a combined view on its configuration data. <em>Commons
      Configuration</em> supports this use case with a special configuration
      builder implementation:
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/CombinedConfigurationBuilder.html">
      CombinedConfigurationBuilder</a></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> is the option of choice for
      applications that have to deal with multiple configuration sources. It
      provides the following features:
      <ul>
        <li>Various configuration sources can be combined to a single
        <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html">
        CombinedConfiguration</a> object. This is a truly hierarchical
        configuration supporting enhanced query facilities.</li>
        <li>As configuration sources the most relevant <code>Configuration</code>
        implementations provided by this library are supported. Sources are
        defined as <a href="howto_beans.html">bean
        declarations</a>, so complex initializations are possible.</li>
        <li>Meta data can be provided to fine-tune the constructed
        configuration.</li>
        <li><code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> is extensible. Custom
        configuration sources can be added.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This document starts with some explanations of
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> basics. Then the <em>configuration
      definition files</em> processed by <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      are discussed in detail. Finally an advanced example is presented.
    </p>

    <subsection name="The configuration definition file">
    <p>
      In previous chapters we have already seen how specific configuration
      classes like <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> or
      <code>XMLConfiguration</code> can be used to load configuration data from
      a single source. <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> now allows
      combining multiple configuration sources to a single
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/CombinedConfiguration.html">
      CombinedConfiguration</a></code> object. The sources to be loaded have to
      be defined in an XML document with a specific structure, a so-called
      <em>configuration definition file</em>. The following listing shows a
      simple example of such a definition file:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <properties fileName="usergui.properties"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      A configuration definition file can contain an arbitrary number of
      elements declaring the configuration sources to load. The
      <code>&lt;properties&gt;</code> element is one of these; it is used to
      include properties files. For this example we store the definition file
      in the same directory as the properties file and call it
      <code>config.xml</code>. The properties file used in this example is the
      same as in the section about <a href="howto_properties.html">properties
      files</a>.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Setting up a CombinedConfigurationBuilder">
    <p>
      Now we have to create a <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> object
      and let it read this definition file. This works in a similar way as
      the construction of other typical <a href="howto_builders.html">
      configuration builders</a>: A new instance is created, and the
      <code>configure()</code> method is called with initialization parameters
      (<code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> is derived from
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/BasicConfigurationBuilder.html">
      BasicConfigurationBuilder</a></code>; so all features common to
      configuration builders are available here as well). The combined configuration collecting
      all sources defined in the configuration definition file can then be
      obtained by calling the builder's <code>getConfiguration()</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest way to define the configuration definition file is to pass an
      initialized parameters object for file-based configurations to the
      builder. In this case, no other specific settings are set for the builder,
      and the file is read as an XML document:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
CombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = new CombinedConfigurationBuilder()
    .configure(params.fileBased().setFile(new File("config.xml")));
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      Now the <em>config</em> object can be accessed in the usual way to query
      configuration properties, e.g. by using methods like <code>getString()</code>,
      or <code>getInt()</code>. A frequent use case is that a configuration
      file is shipped with an application inside its jar archive. For instance,
      the jar could have a special folder where all configuration files are
      located as in the following example:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
/classes
/conf
/conf/mainConfig.xml
/conf/subConfig1.properties
/conf/subConfig2.xml
]]></source>
    <p>
      Here the <em>conf</em> folder in the jar contains a main configuration
      file - this is the definition file for the combined builder - and two
      configuration sources referenced from the main file.
      <code>mainConfig.xml</code> looks as follows:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <properties fileName="subConfig1.properties"/>
  <xml fileName="subConfig2.xml"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      In order to load this file and the referenced configuration sources, the
      previous example can slightly be adapted to determine a URL to the main
      configuration file from the application's class loader:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
CombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = new CombinedConfigurationBuilder()
    .configure(params.fileBased().setURL(
      getClass().getClassLoader().getResource("/conf/mainConfig.xml")
    ));
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      The point to take here is that it is possible to load a combined
      configuration directly from a jar file by specifying the URL to the
      configuration definition file. The configuration sources to be embedded
      are specified as relative paths; they are automatically resolved based on
      the URL of the main configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just defining the configuration definition file
      via a file-based parameters object is a special case. Internally, a builder
      for an <code>XMLConfiguration</code> object is constructed which is then
      used to load and interpret the definition file. This should be appropriate
      for many cases. A drawback of this method is that there is no way to set
      additional initialization parameters for the
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>. For this purpose, a special
      parameters object exists offering some more specialized settings. If this
      object is to be used, information about the file to be loaded can be
      passed via the <code>definitionBuilderParameters</code> property:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
CombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = new CombinedConfigurationBuilder()
    .configure(params.combined().setDefinitionBuilderParameters(
        params.fileBased().setFileName("definition.xml")
    ));
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      In this example, the <code>combined()</code> method of
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/Parameters.html">
      Parameters</a></code> is used to obtain a special parameters object for a
      combined configuration builder. Internally, again a builder for
      constructing an <code>XMLConfiguration</code> for the definition file is
      created. The object stored in the <code>definitionBuilderParameters</code>
      property is passed to this builder's <code>configure()</code> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is even possible to construct the builder for the configuration
      definition file externally and then pass it to the
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> via the
      <code>definitionBuilder</code> property of its initialization parameters
      object:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
// set up the builder for the configuration definition file
ConfigurationBuilder<? extends HierarchicalConfiguration<?>> defBuilder = ...;

// Create the combined builder and pass it the definition builder
CombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = new CombinedConfigurationBuilder()
    .configure(params.combined().setDefinitionBuilder(defBuilder));
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      This is the most flexible variant. It makes it possible in theory to
      read the definition for the combined configuration builder from a
      completely different source. In practice, most applications will stick
      to XML files defining a combined configuration source because this is
      the native format for listing configuration sources and defining
      additional meta data (as described in the following sections). But
      making use of the <code>definitionBuilder</code> property allows at least
      passing in a specially configured builder object. Please refer to the
      section <a href="#Builder_Configuration_Related_to_Combined_Configurations">
      Builder Configuration Related to Combined Configurations</a> for
      additional parameters supported by builders for combined configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not need any specific initialization and just want to read the
      configuration definition from an XML document, the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/Configurations.html">
      Configurations</a></code> helper class introduced in section
      <a href="howto_filebased.html#Making_it_easier">Making it easier</a> is
      made for you. It offers convenience methods for creating a builder for
      combined configurations from various sources. Here is an example how a
      builder can be constructed from a definition file specified as a file
      path:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Configurations configs = new Configurations();
CombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = configs.combinedBuilder("path/to/definition/file.xml");
]]></source>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Overriding properties">
    <p>
      Using <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> to collect configuration
      sources does not make much sense if there is only a single source to be
      loaded. So let's add another one to the example definition file used
      before! This time we will embed a XML file: <em>gui.xml</em> which is
      shown in the next listing:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<gui-definition>
  <colors>
    <background>#808080</background>
    <text>#000000</text>
    <header>#008000</header>
    <link normal="#000080" visited="#800080"/>
  </colors>
  <rowsPerPage>15</rowsPerPage>
</gui-definition>
]]></source>
    <p>
      To make this XML document part of our global configuration we have to
      modify our configuration definition file to also include the new file. For
      XML documents the element <code>&lt;xml&gt;</code> can be used so that we
      have now:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <properties fileName="usergui.properties"/>
  <xml fileName="gui.xml"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      The code for setting up the <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      object remains the same. From the <code>Configuration</code> object
      returned by the factory the new properties can be accessed in the usual
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one open question with this example configuration setup: The
      <code>color.background</code> property is defined in both the properties
      and the XML file, and - to make things worse - with different values.
      Which value will be returned by a call to <code>getString()</code>?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is that the configuration sources are searched in the order
      they are defined in the configuration definition file. Here the properties
      file is included first, then comes the XML file. Because the
      <code>color.background</code> property can be found in the properties file
      the value specified there will be returned (which happens to be
      <code>#FFFFFF</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      It might not be obvious why it makes sense to define the value of one and
      the same property in multiple configuration sources. But consider the
      following scenario: An application comes with a set of default properties
      and allows the user to override some or all of them. This can now easily
      be realized by saving the user's settings in one file and the default
      settings in another. Then in the configuration definition file the file
      with the user settings is included first and after that the file with the
      default values. The application code that queries these settings does not
      have to bother whether a property was overridden by the user. <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      takes care that properties defined in the first file (the user file) are
      found; other properties which the user has not changed will still be
      returned from the second file (the defaults file).
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Optional configuration sources">
    <p>
      The example above with two configuration sources - one for user settings
      and one with default values - raises an interesting question: What happens
      if the user has not defined specific properties yet? Or what if a new user
      starts our application for the first time and thus no user specific
      properties exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      The default behavior of <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> is to
      throw a <code>ConfigurationException</code> exception if one of the sources
      defined in the configuration definition file cannot be loaded. For our
      example this behavior is not desired: the properties file with specific user
      settings is not required. If it cannot be loaded, the example application
      should still work because a complete set of configuration properties is
      defined in the second file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> supports such optional configuration
      sources. For this purpose in the definition of a configuration source the
      <code>config-optional</code> attribute can be placed. An example of this
      is shown below:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <properties fileName="usersettings.properties" config-optional="true"/>
  <properties fileName="default.properties"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      In this configuration definition file the first properties file with user
      specific settings is marked as optional. This means that if it cannot be
      loaded, <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> will not throw an exception,
      but only write a warning message to its logger. Note that the
      <code>config-optional</code> attribute is absent for the second properties
      file. Thus it is mandatory, and the <code>getConfiguration()</code> method
      of <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> would throw an exception if it
      could not be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      A configuration source with the <code>config-optional</code> attribute
      that cannot be loaded is simply ignored; in the resulting combined
      configuration no reference for this source is stored. In the example
      with the user configuration, it would be good if in case of a failure
      (because the user configuration file does not yet exist) an empty
      configuration object is created and added to the combined configuration.
      This configuration object can then be used to store specific user
      settings which the user might define.
    </p>
    <p>
      For configuration sources marked as optional, an additional attribute is
      supported providing exactly this functionality: <code>config-forceCreate</code>.
      If set to <strong>true</strong>, a configuration is created in any case
      for this source. If the source can be loaded successfully, this is of
      course the resulting configuration. Otherwise, an empty configuration
      (of the same type) is created. The example below shows how this attribute
      can be used. Here we also define a name for the configuration source, so
      that the produced configuration can later be retrieved from the resulting
      combined configuration.
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <properties fileName="usersettings.properties" config-name="userConfig"
    config-optional="true" config-forceCreate="true"/>
  <properties fileName="default.properties"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Union configuration">
    <p>
      In an earlier section about the configuration definition file for
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> it was stated that configuration
      files included first can override properties in configuration files
      included later, and an example use case for this behaviour was given. There
      may be cases when there are other requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's continue the example with the application that somehow process
      database tables and that reads the definitions of the affected tables from
      its configuration. This example and the corresponding XML configuration
      files were introduced in the section about
      <a href="howto_hierarchical.html">hierarchical configurations</a>.
      Now consider that this application grows larger and must be maintained by
      a team of developers. Each developer works on a separated set of tables.
      In such a scenario it would be problematic if the definitions for all
      tables were kept in a single file. It can be expected that this file
      needs to be changed very often and thus can be a bottleneck for team
      development when it is nearly steadily checked out. It would be much better
      if each developer had an associated file with table definitions, and all
      these information could be linked together at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> provides support for such a use case,
      too. It is possible to specify in the configuration definition file that
      from a set of configuration sources a logic union configuration is to be
      constructed. Then all properties defined in the provided sources are
      collected and can be accessed as if they had been defined in a single source.
      To demonstrate this feature let us assume that a developer of the database
      application has defined a specific XML file with a table definition named
      <code>tasktables.xml</code>:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<config>
  <table tableType="application">
    <name>tasks</name>
    <fields>
      <field>
        <name>taskid</name>
        <type>long</type>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>name</name>
        <type>java.lang.String</type>
      </field>
      <field>

        <type>java.lang.String</type>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>responsibleID</name>
        <type>long</type>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>creatorID</name>
        <type>long</type>

        <type>java.util.Date</type>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>endDate</name>
        <type>java.util.Date</type>
      </field>
    </fields>
  </table>
</config>
]]></source>
    <p>
      This file defines the structure of an additional table, which should be
      added to the so far existing table definitions. To achieve this the
      configuration definition file has to be changed: A new section is added
      that contains the declaring elements of all configuration sources which
      are to be combined.
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<!-- Configuration definition file that demonstrates the
     override and additional sections -->

<configuration>
  <override>
    <properties fileName="usergui.properties"/>
    <xml fileName="gui.xml"/>
  </override>

  <additional>
    <xml fileName="tables.xml"/>
    <xml fileName="tasktables.xml" config-at="tables"/>
  </additional>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      Compared to the older versions of this file some changes have been done.
      One major difference is that the elements for including configuration
      sources are no longer direct children of the root element, but are now
      contained in either an <code>&lt;override&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;additional&gt;</code>
      section. The names of these sections already imply their purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>override</code> section is not strictly necessary. Elements in
      this section are treated as if they were children of the root element, i.e.
      properties in the included configuration sources override properties in
      sources included later. So the <code>&lt;override&gt;</code> tags could have
      been omitted, but for the sake of clarity it is recommended to use them
      if there is also an <code>&lt;additional&gt;</code> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the <code>&lt;additional&gt;</code> section that introduces a new behaviour.
      All configuration sources listed here are combined to a union configuration.
      In our example we have put two <code>xml</code> elements in this area
      that load the available files with database table definitions. The syntax
      of elements in the <code>additional</code> section is analogous to the
      syntax described so far. In this example the <code>config-at</code>
      attribute is introduced. It specifies the position in the logic union
      configuration where the included properties are to be added. Here it is set
      for the second element to the value <em>tables</em>. This is because the
      file starts with a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element, but to be compatible
      with the other table definition file it should be accessible under the key
      <code>tables.table</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these modifications have been performed, the configuration obtained
      from <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> allows access to three database
      tables. A call of <code>config.getString("tables.table(2).name");</code>
      results in a value of <em>tasks</em>. In an analogous way it is possible
      to retrieve the fields of the third table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that it is also possible to override properties defined in an
      <code>additional</code> section. This can be done by placing a configuration
      source in the <code>override</code> section that defines properties that
      are also defined in one of the sources listed in the <code>additional</code>
      section. The example does not make use of that. Note also that the order of
      the <code>override</code> and <code>additional</code> sections in a
      configuration definition file does not matter. Sources in an <code>override</code>
      section are always treated with higher priority (otherwise they could not
      override the values of other sources).
    </p>
    </subsection>

   <subsection name="Configuration definition file reference">
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>override</code> and <code>additional</code> sections have already
      been introduced when the basics of <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      were discussed. They contain declarations for the configuration sources to be
      embedded. For convenience reasons it is also possible to declare
      configuration sources outside these sections; they are then treated as if
      they were placed inside the <code>override</code> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each declaration of a configuration source is represented by an XML
      element whose name determines the type of the configuration source.
      Attributes or nested elements can be used to provide additional
      configuration options for the sources to be included (e.g. a name of a
      file to be loaded or further flags). Below is a list of all
      tags which can be used out of the box:
    </p>
    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>properties</dt>
        <dd>With this element properties files can be included. The name of
        the file to load is specified using the <code>fileName</code>
        attribute. Which configuration class is created by this tag
        depends on the extension of the file to load: If the extension
        is ".xml", a
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLPropertiesConfiguration.html">
        XMLPropertiesConfiguration</a></code> object is
        created, which is able to process the XML properties format
        introduced in Java 5.0. Otherwise a
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/PropertiesConfiguration.html">
        PropertiesConfiguration</a></code> object is created, the default reader
        for properties files.</dd>
        <dt>xml</dt>
        <dd>The <code>xml</code> element can be used to load XML configuration
        files. It also uses the <code>fileName</code> attribute to
        determine the name of the file to load and creates an instance
        of <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLConfiguration.html">
        XMLConfiguration</a></code>.</dd>
        <dt>jndi</dt>
        <dd>As the name implies, with this element JNDI resources can be
        included in the resulting configuration. Under the hood this is
        done by an instance of the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/JndiConfiguration.html">
        JndiConfiguration</a></code> class. The <code>prefix</code> attribute
        can be used to select a subset of the JNDI tree.</dd>
        <dt>plist</dt>
        <dd>The <code>plist</code> element allows embedding configuration
        files in the NeXT / OpenStep or Mac OS X format. Again the
        name of the file to load is specified through the
        <code>fileName</code> attribute. If a XML file is specified,
        a <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/plist/XMLPropertyListConfiguration.html">
        XMLPropertyListConfiguration</a></code> object is created
        to process the file. Otherwise, this task is delegated to a
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/plist/PropertyListConfiguration.html">
        PropertyListConfiguration</a></code> instance.</dd>
        <dt>system</dt>
        <dd>With this element an instance of
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/SystemConfiguration.html">
        SystemConfiguration</a></code> is added to the resulting configuration
        allowing access to system properties. <em>Note:</em> Using this element
        system properties are directly made available. Alternatively the
        interpolation features (see <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Variable_Interpolation">
        Variable Interpolation</a> for more details) can be used for referencing
        system properties.</dd>
        <dt>ini</dt>
        <dd>This tag can be used to include an ini file into the resulting
        combined configuration. Behind the scenes an instance of
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/INIConfiguration.html">
        INIConfiguration</a></code> is used to load the ini file.</dd>
        <dt>env</dt>
        <dd>With this tag direct access to environment properties can be enabled.
        This works in the same way as the <code>&lt;system&gt;</code> tag for
        Java system properties.</dd>
        <dt>multFile</dt>
        <dd>Using this tag, a builder for a multi-file configuration can be
        integrated into the resulting combined configuration. This is described in a
        <a href="howto_multitenant.html#MultiFileHierarchicalConfiguration">later
        chapter</a>.</dd>
        <dt>configuration</dt>
        <dd>The <code>configuration</code> tag allows other configuration
        definition files to be included. This makes it possible to nest these
        definition files up to an arbitrary depth. In fact, this tag will
        create another <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> object,
        initialize it, and obtain the <code>CombinedConfiguation</code> from it.
        This combined configuration will then be added to the resulting
        combined configuration. Like all file-based configurations the
        <code>fileName</code> attribute can be used to specify the configuration
        definition file to be loaded. This file must be an XML document that
        conforms to the format described here. Some of the most important
        settings are copied from the original <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
        object to the newly created builder:
        <ul>
        <li>the base path under which configuration files are searched</li>
        <li>some flags, e.g. for controlling delimiter parsing or throwing
        exceptions on missing properties</li>
        <li>the logger</li>
        <li>the configuration and error listeners</li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the declaration of a configuration source it is possible to set
      properties on the corresponding configuration objects. Configuration
      declarations are indeed
      <a href="howto_beans.html">Bean declarations</a>. That means they can have attributes matching simple
      properties of the configuration object to create, and sub elements
      matching complex properties. The following example fragment shows how
      complex initialization can be performed in a configuration declaration:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
  <properties fileName="test.properties" throwExceptionOnMissing="true">
    <reloadingDetectorFactory
    config-class="com.foo.MyReloadingDetector" strict=true"/>
  </properties>
  <xml fileName="test.xml" validating="true">
    <expressionEngine config-class="org.apache.commons.configuration2.tree.xpath.XPathExpressionEngine"/>
  </xml>
]]></source>
    <p>
      In this example a configuration source for a properties file and one for
      an XML document are defined. For the properties source the
      <code>throwExceptionOnMissing</code> property is set to <b>true</b>,
      which means that it should throw an exception if a requested property is
      not found. In addition, it is assigned a custom reloading detector, which is
      declared and configured in a sub element. The XML configuration source is
      initialized in a similar way: a simple property is set, and an expression
      engine is assigned. In fact, the properties defined in these declarations
      are not directly set on configuration instances, but on
      <a href="howto_builders.html#Initialization_Parameters">initialization
      parameters objects</a> for configuration builders. These builders are
      created for the declared configuration sources and configured with the
      defined properties. Then their managed configurations are obtained and
      combined into the resulting configuration. Nevertheless, the declarations
      share the same syntax as other bean declarations supported by
      <em>Commons Configuration</em>. More information about the format for
      declaring beans and initializing their properties can be found in the
      section about <a href="howto_beans.html">bean declarations</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the attributes that correspond to properties of the
      configuration sources to be created, a configuration declaration can have a
      set of special attributes that are evaluated by
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> when it creates the objects.
      These attributes are listed in the following table:
    </p>
    <p>
    <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><code>config-name</code></td>
      <td>Allows a name to be specified for this configuration. This name can
      be used to obtain a reference to the configuration from the resulting
      combined configuration (see below).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><code>config-at</code></td>
      <td>With this attribute an optional prefix can be specified for the
      properties of the corresponding configuration.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><code>config-optional</code></td>
      <td>Declares a configuration as optional. This means that errors that
      occur when creating the configuration are silently ignored. The default
      behavior when an error occurs is that no configuration is added to
      the resulting combined configuration. This behavior can be used to find
      out whether an optional configuration could be successfully created or
      not. If you specify a name for the optional configuration (using the
      <code>config-name</code> attribute), you can later check whether the
      combined configuration contains a configuration with this name. With the
      <code>config-forceCreate</code> attribute (see below) this default
      behavior can be changed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><code>config-forceCreate</code></td>
      <td>This boolean attribute is only evaluated for configurations declared as
      optional. It determines the behavior of the combined configuration builder when
      the optional configuration could not be created. If set to <b>true</b>,
      the builder tries to create an empty, uninitialized configuration of the
      correct type and add it to the resulting combined configuration. This is
      especially useful for file-based configurations. Consider a use case
      where an application wants to store user specific configuration files in
      the users' home directories. When a user starts this application for the
      first time, the user configuration does not exist yet. If it is declared
      as <em>optional</em> and <em>forceCreate</em>, the missing configuration
      file won't cause an error, but an empty configuration will be created.
      The application can then obtain this configuration, add properties to it
      (e.g. user specific settings) and save it. Without the
      <code>config-forceCreate</code> attribute the application would have to
      check whether the user configuration exists in the combined configuration
      and eventually create it manually. Note that not all configuration
      providers support this mechanism. Sometimes it may not be possible to
      create an empty configuration if the standard initialization fails. In
      this case no configuration will be added to the combined configuration
      (with other words: the <code>config-forceCreate</code> attribute will not
      have any effect).</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> In older versions of Commons Configuration the attributes
      <code>config-at</code> and <code>config-optional</code> were named
      <code>at</code> and <code>optional</code> respective. They have been
      renamed in order to avoid possible name clashes with property names for
      configuration sources. However, for reasons of backwards compatibility,
      the old attribute names can still be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another useful feature is the built-in support for interpolation (i.e.
      variable substitution): You can use variables in your configuration
      definition file that are defined in declared configuration sources. For
      instance, if the name of a configuration file to be loaded is defined by
      the system property <code>CONFIG_FILE</code>, you can do something like
      this:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<configuration>
  <!-- Load the system properties -->
  <system/>
  <!-- Now load the config file, using a system property as file name -->
  <properties fileName="${CONFIG_FILE}"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      Note that you can refer only to properties that have already been loaded.
      If you change the order of the <code>&lt;system&gt;</code> and the
      <code>&lt;properties&gt;</code> elements in the example above, an error
      will occur because the <code>${CONFIG_FILE}</code> variable will then be
      undefined at the moment it is evaluated.
    </p>
     <source><![CDATA[
<configuration systemProperties="systemProperties.xml">
  <!-- Load the system properties -->
  <system/>
  <!-- Now load the config file, using a system property as file name -->
  <properties fileName="${CONFIG_FILE}"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      This example differs from the previous one by the <code>systemProperties</code>
      attribute added to the root element. It causes the specified properties file to be read
      and all properties defined therein to be added to the system properties.
      So properties like <em>CONFIG_FILE</em> can be defined in a properties
      file and are then treated as if they were system properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The header section</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the header section properties of the resulting combined configuration
      object can be set. The main part of this section is a bean declaration
      that is used for creating the resulting configuration object. Other
      elements can be used for customizing the
      <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html#Node_combiners">Node combiners</a>
      used by the override and the union combined configuration. The following
      example shows a header section that uses some of the supported properties:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
  <header>
    <result throwExceptionOnMissing="true">
      <nodeCombiner config-class="org.apache.commons.configuration2.tree.OverrideCombiner"/>
      <expressionEngine config-class="org.apache.commons.configuration2.tree.xpath.XPathExpressionEngine"/>
    </result>
    <combiner>
      <override>
        <list-nodes>
          <node>table</node>
          <node>list</node>
        </list-nodes>
      </override>
      <additional>
        <list-nodes>
          <node>table</node>
        </list-nodes>
      </additional>
    </combiner>
  </header>
]]></source>
    <p>
      The <code>result</code> element points to the bean declaration for the
      resulting combined configuration. In this example we set some attributes
      and initialize the node combiner (which is not necessary because the
      default override combiner is specified), and the expression engine to be
      used. Note that the <code>config-class</code> attribute makes it
      possible to inject custom classes for the resulting configuration or the
      node combiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>combiner</code> section allows nodes to be defined as list nodes.
      This can be necessary for certain node combiner implementations to work
      correctly. More information can be found in the section about
      <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html#Node_combiners">Node combiners</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some more tags for specific use cases which can occur in the
      header section of a configuration declaration:
      <dl>
        <dt>providers</dt>
        <dd>This tag can be used to define new tags for including custom
        configuration sources. An example is provided later in this document.</dd>
        <dt>fileSystem</dt>
        <dd>Allows defining the <a href="howto_filebased.html#File_Systems">File
        System</a> to be used for file-based configuration sources:
    <source><![CDATA[
<configuration>
  <header>
    <fileSystem
      config-class="org.apache.commons.configuration2.io.VFSFileSystem"/>
  </header>
  <xml fileName="test.xml" config-name="xml"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
        </dd>
        <dt>lookups</dt>
        <dd>In the sub section
        <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Customizing_interpolation">Customizing
        interpolation</a> it was described how variable interpolation can be
        extended by defining custom lookup objects. In the configuration
        definition file of <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> it is
        possible to declare such lookup objects and make them available for
        the processing of this definition file and the resulting combined
        configuration. For this purpose, the header section of the definition
        file can contain a <code>&lt;lookup&gt;</code> element in which an
        arbitrary number of lookups can be defined. Have a look at the
        following example:
    <source><![CDATA[
<configuration>
  <header>
    <lookups>
      <lookup config-prefix="file"
              config-class="com.foo.FileLookup"/>
    </lookups>
  </header>
  <!-- Fetch the file name from a variable -->
  <xml fileName="${file:config_file}" config-name="xml"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>
        Here a custom lookup class is declared and registered under the prefix
        <em>file</em> (as defined by the <code>config-prefix</code> attribute).
        The lookup is immediately active. It is then used to obtain the concrete
        file name for the embedded XML configuration. Note that the variable
        prefix matches the prefix provided in the lookup declaration. The
        variable name is passed to the lookup object, and the custom implementation
        can compute a suitable value.</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> From time to time the question is raised whether there is a
      document type definition or a schema defining exactly the structure of a
      configuration definition file. Frankly, the answer is no. This is due to
      the fact that the format is extensible. As will be shown below, it is
      possible to register your own tags in order to embed custom configuration
      sources.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reloading Support">
    <p>
      The chapter <a href="howto_reloading.html">Automatic
      Reloading of Configuration Sources</a> explains how reloading facilities
      can be enabled for single configuration sources. This feature is also
      useful when working with combined configuration sources. Here you might
      want to support reloading for some or all of the configuration sources
      referenced in the configuration definition file. And - to be really
      flexible - external changes in the configuration definition file itself
      should also be detected and cause a re-construction of the whole
      combined configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable reloading support for combined configurations, <em>Commons
      Configuration</em> provides a special extension of
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>:
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/ReloadingCombinedConfigurationBuilder.html">
      ReloadingCombinedConfigurationBuilder</a></code>. The relation between the
      two is analogous to the relation between
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/FileBasedConfigurationBuilder.html">
      FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</a></code> and
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/ReloadingFileBasedConfigurationBuilder.html">
      ReloadingFileBasedConfigurationBuilder</a></code>. The reloading-enabled
      variant of combined configuration builder manages and exposes a special
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/reloading/ReloadingController.html">
      ReloadingController</a></code> that can be used to trigger reloading
      checks. (Please refer to the chapter about <a href="howto_reloading.html">reloading</a>
      for a detailed description of the reloading implementation in <em>Commons
      Configuration</em> and the components involved.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The reloading controller exposed by a <code>ReloadingCombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      is special because it is also a combined reloading controller. It manages
      the specific reloading controllers of all configuration sources with
      reloading support. So when the reloading controller of the combined
      builder is triggered, in fact all reloading-aware configuration sources
      perform a reload check; sources that have actually been changed generate
      a reloading event causing the invalidation of the combined builder's
      managed configuration - it has to be re-constructed the next time it is
      accessed making the reloaded changes visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The configuration builder providing access to the configuration definition
      file is treated in the same way as a configuration source in respect to
      reloading, i.e. if this builder supports reloading, it becomes part of the
      combined reloading controller. <code>ReloadingCombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      per default creates a reloading-aware builder for its definition configuration
      when no specific builder was defined in the initialization parameters. (If
      a builder for the definition configuration is explicitly passed in the
      initialization parameters, it lies in the responsibility of the caller to
      use a builder with reloading support.)
    </p>
    <p>
      With a <code>ReloadingCombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> in place, enabling
      reload support for specific configuration sources is as simple as adding
      another attribute to the source declaration: <code>config-reload</code>.
      Remember that a combined configuration builder internally creates child
      configuration builders for each of the configuration sources to be loaded.
      For sources having a <code>config-reload</code> attribute with a value of
      <strong>true</strong> a builder with reloading support is created if
      possible. This may not be supported by all types of configuration
      sources, but it is for instance for file-based configuration sources; in
      this case the builder created for a source with enabled reloading support
      is of type <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/ReloadingFileBasedConfigurationBuilder.html">
      ReloadingFileBasedConfigurationBuilder</a></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more complex example of a combined configuration populated from multiple
      sources with reloading support is presented below.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="An example">
    <p>
      After all that theory let's go through a more complex example! We start
      with the configuration definition file that looks like the following:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>
<!-- Test configuration definition file that demonstrates complex initialization -->
<configuration>
  <header>
    <result>
      <expressionEngine config-class="org.apache.commons.configuration2.tree.xpath.XPathExpressionEngine"/>
      <listDelimiterHandler
        config-class="org.apache.commons.configuration2.convert.DefaultListDelimiterHandler">
        <config-constrarg config-value=","/>
      </listDelimiterHandler>
    </result>
    <combiner>
      <additional>
        <list-nodes>
          <node>table</node>
        </list-nodes>
      </additional>
    </combiner>
  </header>
  <override>
    <properties fileName="user.properties" throwExceptionOnMissing="true"
      reloadingRefreshDelay="10000" config-name="properties"
      config-reload="true" config-optional="true"/>
    <xml fileName="settings.xml" config-name="xml"/>
  </override>
  <additional>
    <xml config-name="tab1" fileName="table1.xml" config-at="database.tables"/>
    <xml config-name="tab2" fileName="table2.xml" config-at="database.tables"
        validating="true"/>
  </additional>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      This configuration definition file includes four configuration sources and
      sets some properties for the resulting <code>CombinedConfiguration</code>.
      We also set some properties for the configurations to be loaded; for
      instance we declare that one of the XML configurations should be validated.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the following code we can create a <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      and load this file; because one of the configuration sources supports
      reloading we use the reloading-aware variant of a combined configuration
      builder:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
ReloadingCombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = new ReloadingCombinedConfigurationBuilder()
    .configure(params.fileBased().setFile(new File("configuration.xml")));
CombinedConfiguration cc = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      Here the easiest way to specify the configuration definition file was used:
      a parameters object for a file-based configuration. This is sufficient for
      this example because no other properties for the builder have to be set.
      As described under <a href="#Setting_up_a_CombinedConfigurationBuilder">Setting
      up a CombinedConfigurationBuilder</a>, other options are available. If we
      wanted a special processing of the XML document with the configuration
      definition - e.g. enabling validation to a schema -, we could have passed
      a correspondingly initialized XML parameters object in the
      <code>definitionBuilderParameters</code> property of a combined parameters
      object or even use a specially configured builder for the definition
      configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <code>header</code> section we have chosen an XPATH expression
      engine for the resulting configuration. So we can query our properties
      using the convenient XPATH syntax. We also enabled list delimiter parsing
      by specifying a
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/DefaultListDelimiterHandler.html">
      DefaultListDelimiterHandler</a></code> object. (Note the syntax for
      creating a bean instance via its constructor.) By providing the <code>config-name</code>
      attribute we have given all configuration sources a name. These names can
      be used to obtain the corresponding sources from the combined
      configuration. For configurations in the override section this is
      directly possible:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Configuration propertiesConfig = cc.getConfiguration("properties");
Configuration xmlConfig = cc.getConfiguration("xml");
]]></source>
    <p>
      Configurations in the <code>additional</code> section are treated a bit
      differently: they are all packed together in another combined configuration
      and then added to the resulting combined configuration. So in our example
      the combined configuration <code>cc</code> will contain three configurations:
      the two configurations from the override section, and the combined
      configuration with the <code>additional</code> configurations. The latter
      is stored under a name determined by the <code>ADDITIONAL_NAME</code>
      constant of <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>. The following
      code shows how the configurations of the <code>additional</code> section
      can be accessed:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
CombinedConfiguration ccAdd = (CombinedConfiguration)
  cc.getConfiguration(CombinedConfigurationBuilder.ADDITIONAL_NAME);
Configuration tab1Config = ccAdd.getConfiguration("tab1");
Configuration tab2Config = ccAdd.getConfiguration("tab2");
]]></source>
    <p>
      To make sure that reloading checks are periodically performed, a suitable
      trigger has to be used to ensure that the reloading controller managed by
      the builder is called in regular intervals. This can be done in the same
      way as for simple configuration sources, for instance by setting up a
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/reloading/PeriodicReloadingTrigger.html">
      PeriodicReloadingTrigger</a></code> object:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
PeriodicReloadingTrigger trigger = new PeriodicReloadingTrigger(builder.getReloadingController(),
    null, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
trigger.start();
]]></source>

    <subsection name="Extending the configuration definition file format">
    <p>
      If you have written a custom configuration class, you might want to
      declare instances of this class in a configuration definition file, too.
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> supports this use case by
      registering a
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/ConfigurationBuilderProvider.html">
      ConfigurationBuilderProvider</a></code> object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of a <code>ConfigurationBuilderProvider</code> is to create and
      initialize a configuration builder object which can then be used to obtain
      a configuration source. Whenever <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      encounters a tag in the <code>override</code> or the <code>additional</code>
      section it checks whether for this tag a <code>ConfigurationBuilderProvider</code>
      has been registered. If this is the case, the provider is asked to create a
      new configuration builder instance; otherwise an exception is thrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for adding support for a new configuration class you have to create an
      implementation of <code>ConfigurationBuilderProvider</code> and
      register an instance of it. Registration can be done via the combined
      parameters object passed to the builder which offers a
      <code>registerProvider()</code> method. This method expects the
      name of the associated tag and the provider instance as arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is already a fully functional implementation of the
      <code>ConfigurationBuilderProvider</code> interface available in the class
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/BaseConfigurationBuilderProvider.html">
      BaseConfigurationBuilderProvider</a></code> class. When creating an
      instance the following information has to be passed:
      <ul>
        <li>The fully-qualified name of the configuration builder class to be
        used for the associated configuration source.</li>
        <li>The fully-qualified name of the configuration builder class to be
        used if reloading is enabled for this source. This is optional; if a
        configuration source does not support reloading, <strong>null</strong>
        can be passed here. Then an exception is thrown if a configuration
        source of this type is declared with the <code>config-reload</code>
        attribute set to <strong>true</strong>.</li>
        <li>The fully-qualified name of the configuration class created by
        this builder.</li>
        <li>A collection with parameter object classes supported by this
        builder.</li>
      </ul>
      With this information, <code>BaseConfigurationBuilderProvider</code> can
      create and configure a correct configuration builder object for a specific
      configuration source. In detail, it performs the following steps:
      <ul>
        <li>It determines the builder class to be used based on the presence and
        value of the <code>config-reload</code> attribute; this means that either
        the normal or the reloading builder - if defined - is used.</li>
        <li>An instance of the builder class is created via reflection.</li>
        <li>Instances of all of the parameter object classes are created.</li>
        <li>The parameter objects are initialized from the properties defined
        for the current configuration source.</li>
        <li>The initialized parameter objects are passed to the configuration
        builder's <code>configure()</code> method.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      For most cases, the functionality provided by
      <code>BaseConfigurationBuilderProvider</code> should be sufficient. So
      a properly initialized instance can be directly used for the registration
      of a new builder provider. Let's take a look at an example
      where we want to add support for a configuration class called
      <code>com.foo.MyConfiguration</code>. The class is a file-based configuration;
      therefore, already existing standard builder classes can be used to
      construct instances. (Otherwise, a custom builder implementation has to be
      created, and its name has to be passed to the provider instance.) The
      corresponding tag in the configuration definition file should have the
      name <code>myconfig</code>. The code for registering the new provider and
      loading the configuration definition file looks as follows:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
ConfigurationProvider provider = new BaseConfigurationProvider(
    /* normal builder */
    "org.apache.commons.configuration2.builder.FileBasedConfigurationBuilder",
    /* reloading builder */
    "org.apache.commons.configuration2.builder.ReloadingFileBasedConfigurationBuilder",
    /* configuration class */
    "com.foo.MyConfig",
    /* Parameters; here we assume that we have a custom parameters class
       derived from FileBasedBuilderParametersImpl */
    Collections.singleton(MyConfigParams.class.getName()));

Parameters params = new Parameters();
CombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = new CombinedConfigurationBuilder()
    .configure(
        params.combined()
            .setDefinitionBuilderParameters(
                params.fileBased().setFileName("definition.xml"))
            .registerProvider("myconfig", provider)
    );
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      If your configuration provider is registered this way, your configuration
      definition file can contain the <code>myconfig</code> tag just as any
      other tag for declaring a configuration source:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<configuration>
  <additional>
    <xml fileName="settings.xml"/>
    <myconfig fileName="special.cfg" throwExceptionOnMissing="false"/>
  </additional>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      Alternatively, it is also possible to declare and register custom
      configuration builder providers directly in the configuration definition
      file. This is an interesting option because it makes the definition
      file self-contained; no special initialization is required on the
      configuration builder in order to load them. The registration of builder
      providers is done in the <code>&lt;providers&gt;</code> section in the
      header of the definition file. Each builder provider to be added has to
      be defined by specifying the tag name and the fully-qualified provider
      class. To make use of this mechanism for the custom configuration class
      used in this example, a specialized provider class has to be created
      (before <code>BaseConfigurationBuilderProvider</code> was instantiated
      directly):
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
package com.foo;

public class MyConfigurationBuilderProvider extends BaseConfigurationBuilderProvider
{
    public MyConfigurationBuilderProvider()
    {
        super("org.apache.commons.configuration2.builder.FileBasedConfigurationBuilder",
            "org.apache.commons.configuration2.builder.ReloadingFileBasedConfigurationBuilder",
            "com.foo.MyConfig",
            Collections.singleton(MyConfigParams.class.getName()));
    }
}
]]></source>
    <p>
      Now this class can be referenced in the configuration definition file.
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<configuration>
  <header>
    <providers>
      <provider config-tag="myconfig"
                config-class="com.foo.MyConfigurationBuilderProvider"/>
    </providers>
  </header>
  <additional>
    <xml fileName="settings.xml"/>
    <myconfig fileName="special.cfg" throwExceptionOnMissing="false"/>
  </additional>
</configuration>
]]></source>
    <p>
      Now this file can be processed by a default <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      instance. No special configuration related to builder providers is
      necessary any more:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
CombinedConfigurationBuilder builder = new CombinedConfigurationBuilder()
    .configure(params.fileBased().setFileName("definition.xml"));
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Builder Configuration Related to Combined Configurations">
    <p>
      The special parameters object for <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>
      has already been mentioned and used within examples before. It can be obtained
      from the <code>combined()</code> method of a
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/Parameter.html">
      Parameters</a></code> instance. Its type is
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/CombinedBuilderParameters.html">
      CombinedBuilderParameters</a></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type supports the settings common to all configurations. Additional
      settings specific to <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> are
      defined by the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/CombinedBuilderProperties.html">
      CombinedBuilderProperties</a></code> interface. This includes
      <ul>
        <li>the configuration builder for obtaining the definition configuration</li>
        <li>the parameters object for the configuration builder for obtaining the
        definition configuration</li>
        <li>a base path for file-based configuration sources; sources with a
        relative file name are searched in this path.</li>
        <li>information about
        <a href="#Extending_the_configuration_definition_file_format">custom
        configuration builder providers</a></li>
        <li>default handlers for initialization parameters of configuration
        sources. They work in the same way as global
        <a href="howto_builders.html#Default_Initialization_Parameters">default
        initialization parameters</a> for configuration builders,
        but only impact the configuration sources defined in the current
        definition file. For instance, it is possible to define default settings
        for all XML configuration sources. These are applied for every XML
        source defined in the definition file unless they are overridden there.
        See below for an example.</li>
        <li>controlling the inheritance of builder parameters to child
        configuration builders (see below).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifying default settings for the configuration sources to be included
      is a convenient feature. Often the configuration files to be included
      share similar conventions, and thus can be read using similar
      parameters. Rather than repeating these settings in the configuration
      definition file for each configuration source, there are ways to define
      default settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      One option is to use a mechanism similar to
      <a href="howto_builders.html#Default_Initialization_Parameters">default
      initialization parameters</a>: The parameters object for a combined
      configuration builder allows defining default parameter objects for
      specific types of configuration sources. In the following example all
      XML configuration sources are configured to make use of a specific list
      delimiter handler:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
DefaultListDelimiterHandler listDelimiterHandler = new DefaultListDelimiterHandler(',');
Parameters params = new Parameters();
XMLBuilderParameters xmlParams = params.xml()
    .setListDelimiterHandler(listDelimiterHandler);
XMLBuilderParameters definitionParams = params.xml()
    .setFile(new File("configDefinition.xml"));
CombinedBuilderParameters combinedParameters = params.combined()
    .setDefinitionBuilderParameters(definitionParams)
    .registerChildDefaultsHandler(XMLBuilderProperties.class,
        new CopyObjectDefaultHandler(xmlParams));
builder.configure(combinedParameters);
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      Here the <code>xmlParams</code> object defines default settings for all
      XML configuration sources to be included. Note how it is used to register
      a defaults handler using the <code>registerChildDefaultsHandler()</code>
      method of the parameters object for the combined builder. This mechanism
      of default parameters is very flexible because it allows setting
      different options for different types of configuration sources. However,
      as the example demonstrates, the initialization of the builder becomes
      complex; multiple parameter objects have to be dealt with.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more lightweight alternative is the ability of a combined configuration
      builder to inherit its parameters to the child configurations created by
      it. This feature is enabled by default and it works as follows: Whenever
      a parameter object for a child configuration source is created, it is
      first populated with compatible parameters set for the combined builder.
      Then the specific settings as defined by the configuration definition
      file are applied. So the settings defined for the combined builder as a
      whole serve as a kind of default parameters. With this mechanism the
      following code can be used to set a special list delimiter handler for
      all child configurations and a special expression engine for all
      hierarchical child configurations:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols symbols = new DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.Builder(
    DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.DEFAULT_SYMBOLS)
    .setPropertyDelimiter("/").create();
DefaultExpressionEngine engine = new DefaultExpressionEngine(symbols);
DefaultListDelimiterHandler listDelimiterHandler = new DefaultListDelimiterHandler(',');
XMLBuilderParameters xmlParams = params.xml()
    .setExpressionEngine(engine)
    .setListDelimiterHandler(listDelimiterHandler)
    .setFile(new File("configDefinition.xml"));
builder.configure(xmlParams);
CombinedConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      So here the builder is configured with an XML parameters object which
      defines some default settings and also the file to be loaded. The default
      settings are applied automatically to child configuration sources where
      applicable. This is often a natural approach; for many use cases it makes
      sense that settings defined for the parent combined builder are also
      applied to child configuration sources. Only if child configuration
      sources follow different conventions - maybe some files from a legacy
      system need to be integrated that use a different list delimiter
      character -, inheritance does not help. But in such cases it is often
      possible to use settings inheritance by default and override specific
      settings in affected child configuration sources; of course, the settings
      defined for a configuration source in the configuration definition file
      take precedence over inherited settings. The inheritance mechanism can
      also be turned off completely by invoking
      <code>CombinedBuilderParameters.setInheritSettings()</code> with a
      value of <strong>false</strong>.
