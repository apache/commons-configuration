  <title>Migration Guide: 2.x</title>
 </properties>

<body>
    <section name="Migration Guide Between 2.x Versions">
    <p>
      This document aims to assist with the migration between different versions
      within the 2.x line. While all Commons Configuration artifacts maintain binary 
      compatibility with previous versions with the same major number, there are
      some behavioral and/or configuration differences that may need to be addressed when
      upgrading.
    </p>

    <subsection name="v2.8.0">
    <p>
      Version 2.8.0 of <em>Commons Configuration</em> introduced a change in the variable interpolation lookups
      included by default. In previous versions, all lookups defined in the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/interpol/DefaultLookups.html">DefaultLookups</a></code>
      enum were included by default. With version 2.8.0, some of these lookups are disabled.
      Specifically, the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/interpol/DefaultLookups.html#DNS">dns</a></code>,
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/interpol/DefaultLookups.html#URL">url</a></code>, and
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/interpol/DefaultLookups.html#SCRIPT">script</a></code>
      lookups must now be enabled explicitly. As described in the 
      <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Default_interpolation_lookups">user guide</a>, this can be done either
      programmatically or through a system property. If the behavior of previous versions must be maintained exactly 
      without changes to the code, then the following system property can be used:
<source>
org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol.ConfigurationInterpolator.defaultPrefixLookups=BASE64_DECODER,BASE64_ENCODER,CONST,DATE,DNS,ENVIRONMENT,FILE,JAVA,LOCAL_HOST,PROPERTIES,RESOURCE_BUNDLE,SCRIPT,SYSTEM_PROPERTIES,URL,URL_DECODER,URL_ENCODER,XML
</source>
        If the disabled lookups listed above are not used by the target application, then no changes are required.
