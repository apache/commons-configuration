    <section name="Using Configuration">
      <p>
        Commons Configuration allows you to access configuration properties from
        a variety of different sources. No matter if they are stored in a properties file,
        a XML document, or a JNDI tree, they can all be accessed in the same way
        through the generic <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></code>
        interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another strength of Commons Configuration is its ability to mix configurations
        from heterogeneous sources and treat them like a single logic configuration.
        This section will introduce you to the different configurations
        available and will show you how to combine them.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Configuration Sources">
      <p>
        Currently there are quite a number of different sources of Configuration objects. But,
        by just using a Configuration object versus a specific type like XMLConfiguration or
        JNDIConfiguration, you are sheltered from the mechanics of actually retrieving the
        configuration values. These various sources include:
        <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>PropertiesConfiguration</strong>
              Loads configuration values from a properties file.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>XMLConfiguration</strong>
              Takes values from an XML document.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>INIConfiguration</strong>
              Loads the values from a .ini file as used by Windows.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>PropertyListConfiguration</strong>
              Loads values from an OpenStep .plist file. XMLPropertyListConfiguration is also
              available to read the XML variant used by Mac OS X.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>JNDIConfiguration</strong>
              Using a key in the JNDI tree, can retrieve values as configuration properties.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>BaseConfiguration</strong>
              An in-memory method of populating a Configuration object.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>HierarchicalConfiguration</strong>
              An in-memory Configuration object that is able to deal with complex
              structured data.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>SystemConfiguration</strong>
              A configuration using the system properties
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>ConfigurationConverter</strong>
              Takes a java.util.Properties or an org.apache.commons.collections.ExtendedProperties
              and converts it to a Configuration object.
          </li>
       </ul>

      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="The Configuration interface">
      <p>
        All the classes in this package that represent different kinds of configuration
        sources share a single interface:
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></code>.
        This interface allows you to access and manipulate configuration properties
        in a generic way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The methods defined in the <code>Configuration</code> interface can be
        divided into methods which query data from the configuration and
        methods which alter the configuration object. In fact, the
        <code>Configuration</code> interface extends a base interface called
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/ImmutableConfiguration.html">
        ImmutableConfiguration</a></code>. <code>ImmutableConfiguration</code>
        defines all methods which read data from a configuration object without
        changing its state. <code>Configuration</code> adds methods for
        manipulating the configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major part of the methods defined in the <code>ImmutableConfiguration</code>
        interface deals with retrieving properties of different data types. All
        these methods take a key as an argument that points to the desired
        property. This is a string value whose exact meaning depends on the
        concrete <code>Configuration</code> implementation used. They try to
        find the property specified by the passed in key and convert it to their
        target type; this converted value will be returned. There are also
        overloaded variants of all methods that allow to specify a default value,
        which will be returned if the property cannot be found. The following
        data types are supported out of the box:
        <ul>
          <li>BigDecimal</li>
          <li>BigInteger</li>
          <li>boolean</li>
          <li>byte</li>
          <li>double</li>
          <li>float</li>
          <li>int</li>
          <li>long</li>
          <li>short</li>
          <li>String</li>
        </ul>
        The names of these methods start with <code>get</code> followed by their
        data type. The <code>getString()</code> method for instance will return
        String values, <code>getInt()</code> will operate on integers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properties can have multiple values, so it is also possible to query a
        list or an array containing all of the available values. This is done
        using the <code>getList()</code> or <code>getArray()</code> methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, there are a couple of generic get methods which try to
        convert the requested property value to a specified data type. Such
        conversions are also supported for the elements of collections or arrays.
        More details about conversions can be found in the section
        <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Data_type_conversions">
        Data type conversions</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>subset()</code> method is useful if configuration settings
        are organized in a specific structure and a module of an
        application is only interested in a part of this structure.
        <code>subset()</code> is passed a String with a key prefix and returns
        a <code>Configuration</code> object that contains only the keys starting
        with this prefix.
      </p>
      <p>
        For manipulating properties or their values the following methods can
        be used:
        <dl>
          <dt><code>addProperty()</code></dt>
          <dd>Adds a new property to the configuration. If this property already
          exists, another value is added to it (so it becomes a multi-valued
          property).</dd>
          <dt><code>clearProperty()</code></dt>
          <dd>Removes the specified property from the configuration.</dd>
          <dt><code>setProperty()</code></dt>
          <dd>Overwrites the value of the specified property. This is the same
          as removing the property and then calling <code>addProperty()</code>
          with the new property value.</dd>
          <dt><code>clear()</code></dt>
          <dd>Wipes out the whole configuration</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Immutable Configurations">
      <p>
        Most of the classes provided by the <em>Commons Configuration</em>
        library implement the <code>Configuration</code> interface, i.e. they
        allow client code to change their internal state. For some use cases,
        this may not be desired. For instance, an application may want to
        protect a central configuration object against uncontrolled modifications
        done by sub modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an easy way to convert a normal <code>Configuration</code>
        object into an <code>ImmutableConfiguration</code>: just pass the
        configuration in question to the <code>unmodifiableConfiguration()</code>
        method of the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/ConfigurationUtils.html">
        ConfigurationUtils</a></code> utility class. This results in an
        immutable configuration containing the same data as the original
        configuration.
      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Threading issues">
      <p>
        When accessing configurations from multiple threads - be it in a
        read-only or in a manipulating manner - the question arises whether
        <code>Configuration</code> implementations are thread-safe. When
        using immutable configurations as described in the previous section
        you are typically on the safe side because immutable objects can
        safely be shared between multiple threads. However, the
        <code>ImmutableConfiguration</code> objects created by
        <code>ConfigurationUtils</code> are just wrappers around a mutable
        <code>Configuration</code> object. So if code holds a reference to the
        underlying <code>Configuration</code>, it can still be changed.
      </p>

        Because concurrency is a complex topic this user's guide contains a
        dedicated section to this topic: <a href="howto_concurrency.html">
