    <section name="Composite Configuration Details">
        <p>
            There are many use cases when you want to collect the properties
            of several configuration sources and access them like a single
            configuration object. One way to do that is using the
            <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/CompositeConfiguration.html">
            CompositeConfiguration</a></code> class.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <code>CompositeConfiguration</code> object contains a list of
            other configuration objects. When properties are accessed from a
            composite configuration the object takes the passed in property key
            and iterates over the list of the contained configurations. As soon
            as a value is found for the key it is returned. This means that a
            <code>CompositeConfiguration</code> implements a kind of override
            semantics, i.e. the properties of configurations that were added
            first hide the property values of configurations added later.
        </p>
    	<p>
    		We will discuss how you can establish a "default" choice for your
    		Composite Configuration as well as save changes made to your
    		Composite Configuration.
    	</p>
        <subsection name="Setting Up Defaults">
        <p>
          Defaults are very simple. You can just add them as your last configuration object:
    		</p>
    			<source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration> builderDefaults =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.properties()
        .setFile(fileToDefaults));
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration> builderOther =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.properties()
        .setFile(fileToOtherProperties));

CompositeConfiguration cc = new CompositeConfiguration();
cc.addConfiguration(builderOther.getConfiguration());
cc.addConfiguration(builderDefaults.getConfiguration());
]]></source>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="Saving Changes">
			<p>
				If you have a non static Configuration where you want to
				save changes made to a configuration, and you are using a
				CompositeConfiguration, then you will need to pass into
				the constructor of the CompositeConfiguration what Configuration
				to save the changes via.
			</p>
    			<source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration> builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class, null, true)
    .configure(params.properties()
        .setFile(fileToSaveChangesIn));

Configuration cc = new CompositeConfiguration(builder.getConfiguration());
cc.setProperty("newProperty","new value");

builder.save();
]]></source>
			<p>
				Alternatively, you can just request the
				in-memory configuration that stores the changes. The following
                example fragment copies all properties from the in-memory
                configuration into a <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code>, which
                can be saved later:
    			<source><![CDATA[
Configuration changes = myCompositeConfiguration.getInMemoryConfiguration();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<PropertiesConfiguration> builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<PropertiesConfiguration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class);
PropertiesConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
for (Iterator<String> i = changes.getKeys(); i.hasNext()){
    String key = i.next();
    Object value = changes.get(key);
    config.setProperty(key,value);
}
]]></source>
			</p>
