    <section name="Multi-tenant Configurations">
      <p>
        In a multi-tenant environment a single instance of the application
        will run on behalf of many clients. Typically, this will require
        that each client has its own unique configuration. The easiest
        approach to enable an application to be multi-tenant is for it
        to not really be aware of it at all. This requires that the
        configuration framework takes on some of the responsibility for
        making the application work correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        One approach to enable this support in a web application might be
        to use a Servlet Filter and then use the Log4j or SLF4J MDC to
        save the attributes needed to identify the client. These attributes
        can then be used to identify the specific client configuration to
        be used. The classes described below use this technique to allow
        configurations to transparently provide the configuration appropriate
        for the clients.
      </p>

      <subsection name="MultiFileConfigurationBuilder">
        <p>
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/MultiFileConfigurationBuilder.html">
          MultiFileConfigurationBuilder</a></code> is a specialized configuration
          builder implementation which internally manages a set of builders for
          <a href="howto_filebased.html">file-based configurations</a>. In the
          initialization parameters of this builder a file name pattern has to
          be passed. The pattern can contain keys that will be resolved using the
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/interpol/ConfigurationInterpolator.html">
          ConfigurationInterpolator</a></code> every time the builder's
          <code>getConfiguration()</code> method is called. The resolved pattern
          is then interpreted as the name of a configuration file to be loaded
          by a newly created <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/FileBasedConfigurationBuilder.html">
          FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</a></code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The file-based configuration builder is stored in an internal map
          together with the naming pattern. The next time the same pattern is
          accessed, it can be retrieved from the map and used directly. If the
          evaluation of the pattern changes, a new file-based configuration
          builder is created, and a new configuration file is loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          When used in a <a href="howto_configurationbuilder.html">combined
          configuration</a> it is often acceptable for a file
          matching a particular pattern to be missing. The behavior of
          <code>MultiFileConfigurationBuilder</code> regarding exceptions
          thrown for missing configuration files can be controlled using the
          boolean <em>allowFailOnInit</em> argument accepted by the most generic
          constructor. If here the value <strong>true</strong> is passed,
          exceptions while loading a configuration file are ignored. Instead,
          an empty configuration of the configured type is created for this
          pattern.

        <p>
          The <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/CombinedConfigurationBuilder.html">
          CombinedConfigurationBuilder</a></code> class allows multiple configuration files to be
          merged together. However, it will not collaborate with a <code>MultiFileConfiguration</code>
          properly since the underlying managed configuration will be different depending
          on the resolution of the location pattern.
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/DynamicCombinedConfiguration.html">
          DynamicCombinedConfiguration</a></code> solves this by creating a new
          <code>CombinedConfiguration</code> for each pattern.

           This sample configuration illustrates how to use
           <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/CombinedConfigurationBuilder.html">

        <p>
          In this example configuration definition file for a
          <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> two configuration sources
          are declared:
          <ul>
            <li>A multi-file source with a file pattern containing a system
            property. This means that depending on the current value of this
            system property a different configuration file is loaded. Because
            this source is declared as optional it is legal that for certain
            values of the property no configuration file exists.</li>
            <li>An XML configuration source with common setting independent on
            the value of a system property. This source may also contain
            default values in case no configuration file could be loaded by the
            multi-file source.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Of special importance is the declaration of the result configuration
          in form of the <code>&lt;result&gt;</code> element in the <em>header</em>
          section. Here the <code>config-class</code> attribute specifies that
          an instance of <code>DynamicCombinedConfiguration</code> is created
          rather than a default <code>CombinedConfiguration</code> object. Also,
          the value of the <em>keyPattern</em> property is set which has to
          conform to the pattern used by the multi-file source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note how the variables have multiple '$'. This is how variables are escaped and
          is necessary because the variables will be interpolated multiple times. Each
          attempt will remove the leading '$'. When there is only a single '$' in front
          of the '{' the interpolator will then resolve the variable. The first extra '$'
          is necessary because <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> will interpolate any variables
          in the configuration. In the case of the multi-file configuration item two
          leading '$' characters are necessary before the variable because it will be
          interpolated by both <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> and <code>DynamicCombinedConfiguration</code>
          before <code>MultiFileConfigurationBuilder</code> gets the chance to evaluate it.
          Although in this example one would not expect system properties to change
          at runtime, other types of lookups such as the MDCStrLookup provided with
          SLF4J require that the variables be evaluated as the configuration is being
          accessed instead of when the configuration file is processed to behave as desired.

          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/MultiFileConfigurationBuilder.html">
          MultiFileConfigurationBuilder</a></code> a special object with
          initialization parameters can be used as argument to the
          <code>configure()</code> method. It is of type
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/MultiFileBuilderParameters.html">
          MultiFileBuilderParameters</a></code> and can be obtained via the

          Parameters</a></code> object. The properties specific to this

          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/MultiFileBuilderProperties.html">
          MultiFileBuilderProperties</a></code> interface. They include
          <ul>
            <li>The pattern string for determining the name of the
            configuration file to be loaded. This is of course the most
            important setting as it tells the builder how to perform interpolation
            in order to resolve the correct configuration file.</li>
            <li>A parameters object for the file-based configuration builder
            used behind the scenes to load the configuration file. Here some
            additional settings can be provided. For instance, if the
            configuration files to be loaded are XML documents, validation
            could be enabled via these parameters.</li>

        <p>
          Applications are often composed of many components each of which need their
          own configuration. This can be accommodated by having a configuration file
          per component, but this can make things hard to manage when there are many
          clients and many components. A second approach is to combine them into
          a single configuration file. However, this either means the subcomponent
          has to be aware of the surrounding configuration and navigate past it or the
          application must be provided just the portion of the configuration it
          can process. <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/PatternSubtreeConfigurationWrapper.html">
          PatternSubtreeConfigurationWrapper</a></code> can be used for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normal practice when using dependency injection frameworks is to have the
          attributes needed to make components work correctly injected into them.
          When working with Commons Configuration this works very well. Components
          simply need to have a
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">
          HierarchicalConfiguration</a></code> attribute along with
          a corresponding setter and getter. The injection framework can then be
          used to provide the component with the correct configuration using
          <code>PatternSubtreeConfigurationWrapper</code> as shown in the next example.

          This example shows a <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>
          configuration defining beans to be used in an application. The bean
          named &quot;MyComponent&quot; is a component with its own
          configuration which is injected into the <em>configuration</em>
          property. Here an instance of <code>PatternSubtreeConfigurationWrapper</code>
          is passed (defined by the &quot;subcomponentConfig&quot; bean) that
          selects a subtree in the configuration data specific to this component;
          the corresponding prefix is defined as second constructor argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also of interest how the global configuration of the
          application is defined. It is loaded by a configuration builder
          declared by the &quot;configurationBuilder&quot; bean. The fluent
          API offered by configuration builders does not work very well here.
          Therefore, the builder is initialized via a map with settings passed
          to its constructor. Simple properties to be propagated to the
          managed configuration instance can be declared directly as keys of
          this map. The configuration of the file to be loaded is an
          exceptional case: This information is stored internally as a
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileHandler.html">
          FileHandler</a></code> object, and the properties of this object are
          contained in a sub map under the key <em>config-fileBased</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the declaration of the configuration builder in place, the actual
          configuration object can now be defined as bean using the builder's
          <code>getConfiguration()</code> method as factory method. From
          there it can be injected into arbitrary other beans.
