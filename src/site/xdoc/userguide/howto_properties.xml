    <section name="Properties files">
      <p>
        Properties files are a popular means of configuring applications. Of course, <em>Commons Configuration</em>
        supports this format and enhances significantly the basic <code>java.util.Properties</code> class.
        This section introduces the features of the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/PropertiesConfiguration.html">PropertiesConfiguration</a></code> class.
        Note that <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> is a very typical example
        for an implementation of the <code>Configuration</code> interface; it
        extends
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/AbstractConfiguration.html">AbstractConfiguration</a></code>,
        thus all the features provided by this base class are available here as
        well. More information about functionality common to all standard
        <code>Configuration</code> implementations can be found in the section
        <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html">Basic features and AbstractConfiguration</a>.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Using PropertiesConfiguration">
        <p>
          Let's start with a simple properties file named
          <code>usergui.properties</code> with the following content:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
# Properties definining the GUI
colors.background = #FFFFFF
colors.foreground = #000080

window.width = 500
window.height = 300
]]></source>

        <p>
          To load this file, you'll write something like:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<FileBasedConfiguration> builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<FileBasedConfiguration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.properties()
        .setFileName("usergui.properties"));
try
{
    Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration();
    ...
}
catch(ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // loading of the configuration file failed
}]]></source>
        <p>
          As is demonstrated by this example, a configuration object for a
          properties file is obtained via a
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/FileBasedConfigurationBuilder.html">
          FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</a></code> as described in the section
          <a href="howto_filebased.html">File-based Configurations</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the properties file was loaded you can access its content through
          the methods of the <code>Configuration</code> interface, e.g.
        </p>
<source>
String backColor = config.getString("colors.background");
Dimension size = new Dimension(config.getInt("window.width"),
  config.getInt("window.height"));
</source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Includes">
        <p>
          If a property is named "<code>include</code>", and the value of that property is the
          name of a file on the disk, that file will be included into the configuration. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference between "<code>include</code>" and "<code>includeOptional</code>" (below) is that if the file value 
          is absent, processing continues with "<code>includeOptional</code>" but stops with "<code>include</code>".
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:
        </p>
<source>
# usergui.properties

include = colors.properties
include = sizes.properties
</source>

<source>
# colors.properties

colors.background = #FFFFFF
</source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Oprional Includes">
        <p>
          If a property is named "<code>includeOptional</code>", and the value of that property is the
          name of a file on the disk, that file will be included into the configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference between "<code>include</code>" (above) and "<code>includeOptional</code>" is that if the file value 
          is absent, processing continues with "<code>includeOptional</code>" but stops with "<code>include</code>".
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:
        </p>
<source>
# usergui.properties

includeOptional = colors.properties
includeOptional = sizes.properties
</source>

<source>
# colors.properties

colors.background = #FFFFFF
</source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Lists and arrays">
        <p>
          As was already pointed out in the section
          <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#List_handling">List handling</a>
          of <em>Basic features</em>, <em>Commons Configuration</em> has the ability to
          return easily a list of values. For example, a properties file can
          contain a list of comma separated values:
        </p>
<source>
# chart colors
colors.pie = #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF
</source>
        <p>
          Provided that an appropriate
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/ListDelimiterHandler.html">
          ListDelimiterHandler</a></code> object was set for the
          configuration instance, the value is split automatically, and
          you can retrieve an array or a <code>java.util.List</code> directly with:
        </p>
<source>
String[] colors = config.getStringArray("colors.pie");
List&lt;Object&gt; colorList = config.getList("colors.pie");
</source>
        <p>
          Splitting of string values at list delimiter characters is disabled
          by default. It can be enabled by specifying an instance of
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/DefaultListDelimiterHandler.html">
          DefaultListDelimiterHandler</a></code>. This can be done when loading
          the configuration via the builder:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration> builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.properties()
        .setFileName("usergui.properties")
        .setListDelimiterHandler(new DefaultListDelimiterHandler(','));
Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can specify a list of values in your properties file by using
          the same key on several lines as shown in the following example. This is an
          example of a feature not provided by <code>java.util.Properties</code>:
        </p>
<source>
# chart colors
colors.pie = #FF0000;
colors.pie = #00FF00;
colors.pie = #0000FF;
</source>
        <p>
          All of the features related to list handling described for
          <code>AbstractConfiguration</code> also apply to properties files,
          including changing the list delimiter or disabling list handling at
          all.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Saving">
        <p>
          To save your configuration, just call the <code>save()</code> method
          on the associated configuration builder.
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<FileBasedConfiguration> builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<FileBasedConfiguration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.properties()
        .setFileName("usergui.properties")
        .setListDelimiterHandler(new DefaultListDelimiterHandler(',')));
Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration();
config.setProperty("colors.background", "#000000");
builder.save();
]]></source>
        <p>
          More information about saving properties files (and file-based
          configurations in general) can be found in the section about
          <a href="howto_filebased.html">File-based Configurations</a>.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Special Characters and Escaping">
        <p>
          If you need a special character in a property like a line feed, a tabulation or
          an unicode character, you can specify it with the same escaped notation used for
          Java Strings. The list separator ("," by default), can also be escaped:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
key = This \n string \t contains \, escaped \\ characters \u0020
]]></source>
      <p>
        When dealing with lists of elements that contain backslash characters
        (e.g. file paths on Windows systems) escaping rules can become pretty
        complex. The first thing to keep in mind is that in order to get a
        single backslash, you have to write two:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
config.dir = C:\\Temp\\
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        This issue is not specific to <em>Commons Configuration</em>, but is related to
        the standard format for properties files. Refer to the Javadocs of the
        <code>load()</code> method of <code>java.util.Properties</code> for more
        information. Now if you want to define a list with file paths, you may
        be tempted to write the following:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
# Wrong way to define a list of directories
config.dirs = C:\\Temp\\,D:\\data\\
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        As the comment indicates, this will not work. The trailing backslash of
        the first directory is interpreted as escape character for the list
        delimiter. So instead of a list with two elements only a single value
        of the property is defined - clearly not what was desired. To get a
        correct list the trailing backslash has to be escaped. This is achieved
        by duplicating it (yes, in a properties file that means that we now need
        4 backslashes):
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
# Correct way to define a list of directories
config.dirs = C:\\Temp\\\\,D:\\data\\
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        So a sequence of 4 backslashes in the value of a property is interpreted
        as an escaped backslash and eventually results in a single backslash.
        This creates another problem when a properties file should refer to the
        names of network shares. Typically these names start with two
        backslashes, so the obvious way to define such a property is as follows:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
# Wrong way to define a list of network shares
config.dirs = \\\\share1,\\\\share2
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this will not work because the shares contain the reserved
        sequence of 4 backslashes. So when reading the value of the
        <em>config.dirs</em> property a list with two elements is returned
        starting only with a single backslash. To fix the problem the sequence
        for escaping a backslash has to be duplicated - we are now at 8
        backslashes:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
# Correct way to define a list of network shares
config.dirs = \\\\\\\\share1,\\\\\\\\share2
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        As becomes obvious, escape sequences can become pretty complex and
        unreadable. In such situations it is recommended to use the alternative
        way of defining a list: just use the same key multiple times. In this
        case no additional escaping of backslashes (beyond the usual duplicating
        required by properties files) is needed because there is no list
        delimiter character involved. Using this syntax the list of network
        shares looks like the following:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
# Straightforward way to define a list of network shares
config.dirs = \\\\share1
config.dirs = \\\\share2
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        Please also refer to the Javadocs of the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/DefaultListDelimiterHandler.html">
        DefaultListDelimiterHandler</a></code> class; it describes the
        escaping rules to be applied in detail.
      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Layout Objects">
      <p>
        Each <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> object is associated with a
        <em>Layout object</em>, an instance of the class
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/PropertiesConfigurationLayout.html">
        PropertiesConfigurationLayout</a></code>. This layout object is
        responsible for preserving most of the structure of loaded configuration
        files. This means that things like comments or blank lines in a saved
        properties file will closely resemble the original properties file
        (the algorithm is not 100 percent perfect, but for most use cases it
        should be sufficient).
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally a developer does not have to deal with these layout objects.
        However, there are some methods that might be of interest if enhanced
        control over the output of properties files is needed. The following
        list describes these methods (note that corresponding get methods are
        of course also provided):
        <ul>
        <li><code>setComment()</code><br/>
        With this method a comment can be set for a specified property. When
        storing the configuration the comment is output before the property,
        followed by a line break. The comment can span multiple lines; in this
        case the newline character &quot;\n&quot; must be used as line
        separator.</li>
        <li><code>setHeaderComment()</code><br/>
        With <code>setHeaderComment()</code> a global comment can be set for the
        properties file. This comment is written at the very start of the file,
        followed by an empty line.</li>
        <li><code>setFooterComment()</code><br/>
        Analogous to <code>setHeaderComment()</code>, but the comment defined by
        this method is written at the very end of the properties file.</li>
        <li><code>setBlancLinesBefore()</code><br/>
        This methods allows defining the number of empty lines to be written
        before the specified property. It can be used, for instance, to
        divide the properties file into multiple logical sections.</li>
        <li><code>setSingleLine()</code><br/>
        If a property has multiple values, with <code>setSingleLine()</code> it
        can be specified that all these values should be written into a single
        line separated by the default list separator. It is also possible to
        write multiple definitions for this property (i.e. multiple lines of the
        form <code>property = value1</code>, <code>property = value2</code> etc.).
        This is supported by <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code>, but will
        probably not work when processing the properties file with other tools.
        </li>
        <li><code>setForceSingleLine()</code><br/>
        This is similar to <code>setSingleLine()</code>, but sets a global
        single line flag. If set to <b>true</b>, all properties with multiple
        values are always written on a single line.</li>
        <li><code>setGlobalSeparator()</code><br/>
        Sometimes it may be necessary to define the properties separator, i.e.
        the string that separates the property key from the value. This can be
        done using <code>setGlobalSeparator()</code>. Here an arbitrary string
        can be specified that will be used as separator. (Note: In order to
        produce valid properties files only the characters <code>=</code> and
        <code>:</code> should be used as separators (with or without leading or
        trailing whitespace), but the method does not enforce this.</li>
        <li><code>setSeparator()</code><br/>
        This method is similar to <code>setGlobalSeparator()</code>, but
        allows setting the property separator for a specific property.</li>
        <li><code>setLineSeparator()</code><br/>
        Using this method the line separator can be specified. Per default the
        platform-specific line separator is used (e.g. <code>\n</code> on unix).
        </li>
        </ul>
        The default settings of <code>PropertiesConfigurationLayout</code> are
        chosen in a way that most of the original layout of a properties file
        is retained. With the methods listed above specific layout restrictions
        can be enforced.
      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Custom properties readers and writers">
      <p>
        There are situations when more control over the process of reading and
        writing properties files is needed. For instance, an application might
        have to deal with some legacy properties file in a specific format,
        which is not supported out of the box by
        <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code>, but must not be modified. In these
        cases it is possible to inject a custom reader and writer for
        properties files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Per default properties files are read and written by the nested classes
        <code>PropertiesReader</code> and <code>PropertiesWriter</code>
        (defined within <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code>). These classes are
        regular reader and writer classes (both are derived from typical base
        classes of the <code>java.io</code> package) that provide some
        additional methods making dealing with properties files more
        convenient. Custom implementations of properties readers and writers
        must extend these base classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For installing a custom properties reader or writer
        <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> provides the <code>IOFactory</code>
        interface (which is also defined as a nested class). An object
        implementing this interface is stored in each
        <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> instance. Whenever a properties
        file is to be read or written (i.e. when one of the <code>load()</code>
        or <code>save()</code> methods is called), the <code>IOFactory</code>
        object is asked for creating the properties reader or writer to be
        used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>IOFactory</code> interface is pretty simple; it defines one
        method for creating a properties reader and another one for creating a
        properties writer. A default implementation called
        <code>DefaultIOFactory</code> is also available and is used by
        <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> when no specific
        <code>IOFactory</code> is set.<br/>
        The original goal of <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> wasn't to be
        strictly compatible with the exact file format defined in
        <code>java.util.Properties</code> (JUP). However, in cases where this
        compatibility is required, the alternative <code>JupIOFactory</code> can
        be used, as it aims to mimic the exact behavior of <code>JUP</code>. The
        main differences concern the handling of leading and trailing whitespace
        and the handling of escape sequences. <code>JupIOFactory</code> can also
        be configured to avoid Unicode escape sequences (like \u00DF) when
        the used encoding already supports all characters natively. E.g. UTF-8
        is the new default encoding for resource bundle properties files since
        Java 9, so Unicode escapes are not required anymore and not using them
        can make properties files much more readable in regular text editors.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this discussion more concrete we provide an example of how to
        inject a custom properties reader. The use case is that we have to load
        a properties file that contains keys with whitespace, which is not
        supported by <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> per default. A
        fragment from such a properties file could look as follows:
      </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
Background Color = #800080
Foreground Color = #000080
]]></source>
      <p>
        The first step is to create a custom properties reader implementation
        that can deal with such properties. The class is derived from
        <code>PropertiesConfiguration.PropertiesReader</code> and overrides the
        <code>parseProperty()</code> method:
      </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
public class WhitespacePropertiesReader extends PropertiesConfiguration.PropertiesReader
{
    public WhitespacePropertiesReader(Reader in, char delimiter)
    {
        super(in, delimiter);
    }

    /**
     * Special algorithm for parsing properties keys with whitespace. This
     * method is called for each non-comment line read from the properties
     * file.
     */
    @Override
    protected void parseProperty(String line)
    {
        // simply split the line at the first '=' character
        // (this should be more robust in production code)
        int pos = line.indexOf('=');
        String key = line.substring(0, pos).trim();
        String value = line.substring(pos + 1).trim();

        // now store the key and the value of the property
        initPropertyName(key);
        initPropertyValue(value);
    }
}
]]></source>
      <p>
        Notice the calls to the methods <code>initPropertyName()</code> and
        <code>initPropertyValue()</code>. Here the results of the parsing
        operation are stored. The next step is to provide a specialized
        implementation of the <code>IOFactory</code> interface that returns
        the new properties reader class. As we only want to replace the
        properties reader (and use the standard writer), we can derive our
        implementation from <code>DefaultIOFactory</code> and thus only have
        to override the <code>createPropertiesReader()</code> method.
      </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
public class WhitespaceIOFactory extends PropertiesConfiguration.DefaultIOFactory
{
    /**
     * Return our special properties reader.
     */
     @Override
    public PropertiesReader createPropertiesReader(Reader in, char delimiter)
    {
        return new WhitespacePropertiesReader(in, delimiter);
    }
}
]]></source>
      <p>
        Finally an instance of our new <code>IOFactory</code> implementation
        has to be created and passed to the <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code>
        object. This can be done via the initialization parameters passed to
        the configuration builder:
      </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration> builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<Configuration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.properties()
        .setFileName("myfile.properties")
        .setIOFactory(new WhitespaceIOFactory());
Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Builder Configuration Related to Properties Files">
      <p>
        When setting up a configuration builder to produce a
        <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> instance typically an object
        implementing the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/PropertiesBuilderParameters.html">
        PropertiesBuilderParameters</a></code> interface is used. In addition
        to the parameters common to all file-based configurations, there are
        settings specific to properties files which are defined by the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/PropertiesBuilderProperties.html">
        PropertiesBuilderProperties</a></code> interface. These include
        <ul>
          <li>A flag whether <a href="#Includes">include files</a> are supported.
          This is <strong>true</strong> by default, but can be switched off if
          properties named <em>include</em> should not have a special meaning.</li>
          <li>A custom <a href="#Layout_Objects">layout object</a>.</li>
