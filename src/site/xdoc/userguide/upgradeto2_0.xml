      This document aims at supporting with the migration from version 1.x of
      <em>Commons Configuration</em> to version 2.0. Target audience are
      users of an older version who want to upgrade. The document describes the
      areas in which major changes have been implemented; here problems are
      likely to be encountered during migration. It has the following content:

    <subsection name="Introduction">
    <p>
      Version 2.0 of <em>Commons Configuration</em> is the result of a major
      redesign of this library. While version 1.x has become pretty stable and
      does what it is expected to do, there are some limitations and design
      flaws which could not be fixed in a painless and compatible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to overcome these restrictions, version 2.0 has applied significant
      changes to some of the problematic concepts or even replaced them by
      alternative approaches. This has lead to an ambivalent situation: On one
      hand, you will recognize many similarities to the old version - classes
      with familiar names that continue to do what they have done before. On
      the other hand, completely new approaches have been introduced; in the
      affected areas <em>Commons Configuration</em> 2.0 will look like a
      completely new product rather than a plain upgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of such major changes, you cannot simply drop the new jar in your
      classpath and expect that everything continues to work. In the remaining
      part of this document the most important changes are described. This
      should give you an impression about the effort required to integrate the
      new version with your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that the <a href="user_guide.html">user's guide</a> has been
      fully reworked to cover all the new features and concepts offered by
      <em>Commons Configuration</em> 2.0. Because of that, this document will not
      describe interfaces or classes in detail, but simply refer to the
      corresponding sections of the user guide.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Structural Changes">
    <p>
      The most obvious change you will notice at the very beginning is that
      the root package was renamed to <code>org.apache.commons.configuration2</code>
      - the major version is now part of the package name. This certainly makes
      migration harder, but it is the only possibility to avoid jar hell.
      Imagine for a moment that we had kept the old package name. This
      would work well for applications that are the only user of the
      <em>Commons Configuration</em> library. But as soon as there are 3rd
      party libraries also using this component, but in version 1.x, then there
      is real trouble: The class path then contains classes with identical
      names in different versions - results will be unpredictable! The change
      of the package name solves this problem because the new version can now
      coexist with an old version without interfering. The very first step
      you have to when migrating to version 2.0 is to reorganize your imports
      to adapt them to the new package name. Modern IDEs will support you with
      this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the same reason the <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
      coordinates have been changed. Use the following dependency declaration
      in your pom:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-configuration2</artifactId>
  <version>2.5</version>
</dependency>
]]></source>
    <p>
      So for Maven version 2.0 is a completely different artifact. This
      allows a peaceful coexistence of <em>Commons Configuration</em> 1.x and
      2.0 in the dependency set of a project.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Accessing Configuration Properties">
    <p>
      The good news is that there are only minor changes in the central
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/Configuration.html">
      Configuration</a></code> interface used for reading and writing configuration
      data. A few methods have been added supporting new features, but the
      principle patterns for dealing with <code>Configuration</code> objects
      remain valid. These concepts are described in the user's guide in the
      sections <a href="overview.html#Using_Configuration">Using Configuration</a>
      and <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Basic_features_and_AbstractConfiguration">Basic
      features and AbstractConfiguration</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has changed is the default implementation of
      <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#List_handling">List handling</a> in
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/AbstractConfiguration.html">
      AbstractConfiguration</a></code>. In version 1.x list splitting was
      enabled per default; string properties containing a &quot;,&quot; character
      were interpreted as lists with multiple elements. This was a frequent
      source for confusion and bug reports. In version 2.0 list splitting is now
      disabled initially. The implementation also has been extended: it is no
      longer limited to providing a delimiter character, but an implementation
      of the <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/ListDelimiterHandler.html">
      ListDelimiterHandler</a></code> interface can be set which controls all
      aspects of list handling. In order to enable list handling again, pass a
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/DefaultListDelimiterHandler.html">
      DefaultListDelimiterHandler</a></code> object to your
      <code>AbstractConfiguration</code> instance. This class supports splitting
      string properties at specific delimiter characters. However, its results
      are not 100% identical to the ones produced by <em>Commons Configuration</em>
      1.0: this version contained some inconsistencies regarding the escaping of
      list delimiter characters. If you really need the same behavior in this
      area, then use the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/LegacyListDelimiterHandler.html">
      LegacyListDelimiterHandler</a></code> class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version 2.0 also has changes related to
      <a href="howto_hierarchical.html#Hierarchical_Configurations">Hierarchical
      Configurations</a>.
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      HierarchicalConfiguration</a></code>, formally the base class for all
      hierarchical configurations, is now an interface. The equivalent to the
      old base class is now named
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/BaseHierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      BaseHierarchicalConfiguration</a></code>. It extends the abstract base class
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration</a></code>. The difference between these
      classes is that <code>AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration</code> provides
      generic algorithms for dealing with an arbitrary hierarchical node
      structure. <code>BaseHierarchicalConfiguration</code> in contrast defines
      its own node structure based on objects kept in memory. In future, it
      should be possible to support other kinds of hierarchical structures
      directly by creating specialized sub classes from
      <code>AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration</code>. Refer to section
      <a href="howto_hierarchical.html#Internal_Representation">Internal Representation</a>
      for further information. The node objects a hierarchical configuration
      deals with are now exposed as a generic type parameter; for instance,
      <code>BaseHierarchicalConfiguration</code> is actually an
      <code>AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration&lt;ImmutableNode&gt;</code>.
      For most applications only interested in accessing configuration data via
      the typical access methods, this parameter is not relevant and can be
      replaced by a wildcard (&quot;?&quot;) in variable declarations. Extended
      query facilities on hierarchical configurations work in the same way as
      in version 1.x; so applications need not be updated in this area.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Creating Configurations">
    <p>
      A major difference between <em>Commons Configuration</em> 1.x and 2.0 is
      the way configuration objects are created, initialized, and managed. In
      version 1.x configurations are created directly using their constructor.
      Especially for file-based configuration implementations - like
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/PropertiesConfiguration.html">
      PropertiesConfiguration</a></code> or
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLConfiguration.html">
      XMLConfiguration</a></code> - there were constructors which immediately
      populated the newly created instances from a data source. If additional
      settings were to be applied, this was done after the creation using
      bean-like set methods. For instance, in order to create an initialized
      <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> object, the following code could be
      used:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
// Version 1.x: Initializing a properties configuration
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("myconfig.properties");
config.setThrowExceptionOnMissing(true);
config.setIncludesAllowed(false);
config.setListDelimiter(';');
]]></source>
    <p>
      While this code is easy to write, there are some non-obvious problems:
      <ul>
        <li>Some settings influence the loading of the configuration data. In
        this example, the definition of the list delimiter and the
        <em>includesAllowed</em> flag fall into this category. However, because
        the data is directly loaded by the constructor these settings are
        applied too late and thus ignored by the load operation.</li>
        <li>The constructor calls a protected method for loading the data. This
        can lead to subtle bugs because at this time the instance is not yet
        fully initialized.</li>
        <li>The various set methods are not thread-safe; if this configuration
        instance is to be accessed from another thread, there may be problems.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To overcome these problems, <em>Commons Configuration</em> uses a
      different approach for the creation of configuration objects based on
      <a href="howto_builders.html">configuration builders</a>. The basic idea
      is that a configuration builder is created and initialized with all
      parameters to be applied to the new configuration object. When the
      configuration instance is queried from its builder it is guaranteed that
      it has been fully initialized in the correct order. In addition, access
      to configuration builders is thread-safe. Configuration builders offer a
      fluent API for setting the initialization parameters for the configuration
      to be created. The example above would become something like the
      following in version 2.0:
    </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<PropertiesConfiguration> builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder<PropertiesConfiguration>(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(new Parameters().properties()
        .setFileName("myconfig.properties")
        .setThrowExceptionOnMissing(true)
        .setListDelimiterHandler(new DefaultListDelimiterHandler(';'))
        .setIncludesAllowed(false));
PropertiesConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
]]></source>
    <p>
      Builders also offer an increased flexibility regarding the management of
      configuration objects. While in version 1.x of <em>Commons Configuration</em>
      typically <code>Configuration</code> objects were kept centrally and
      accessed throughout an application, the recommended way in version 2.0 is
      to work with configuration builders. A builder not only creates a new
      configuration object but also caches a reference to it so that it can be
      accessed again and again. This makes it possible to add special
      functionality to the builder. For instance, it may decide to return a
      different configuration object under certain circumstances - e.g. when a
      change on an external configuration source is detected and a reload
      operation is performed. For the application this is fully transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with builders may seem a bit verbose at first. There are some ways
      to simplify their usage. Be sure to read the section
      <a href="howto_filebased.html#Making_it_easier">Making it easier</a>
      which describes some useful short cuts. It is also possible to define
      default values for initialization parameters. This allows simplifying of
      builder configurations and can establish application-global standard
      settings for configuration objects. This mechanism is described in
      <a href="howto_builders.html#Default_Initialization_Parameters">Default
      Initialization Parameters</a>.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Reloading">
    <p>
      Support for reloading of externally changed configuration sources was
      limited in <em>Commons Configuration</em> 1.x. There was a reloading
      strategy implementation that was triggered on each access to a
      configuration property and checked whether an underlying file was changed
      in the meantime. If this was the case, the configuration was automatically
      reloaded. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CONFIGURATION-520">
      CONFIGURATION-520</a> contains a discussion about the problems and
      limitations of this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      In version 2.0 reloading functionality has been completely redesigned.
      The new approaches are described in the chapter
      <a href="howto_reloading.html">Automatic Reloading of Configuration
      Sources</a> of the user's guide. In a nutshell,
      <a href="howto_builders.html">configuration builders</a> play an important
      role here. There are builder implementations available which can be
      configured to monitor external configuration sources in a pretty generic
      way. When a change is detected, the builder resets its managed configuration
      so that the next time it is accessed a new instance is created. In addition,
      an event can be generated notifying the application that new configuration
      information might be available. The whole mechanism can be setup to
      perform reloading checks periodically and automatically in a background
      thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>FileChangedReloadingStrategy</code> class from version 1.0
      no longer exists. It is replaced by the new, more powerful reloading
      mechanisms. The mentioned chapter about <a href="howto_reloading.html">reloading</a>
      describes in detail how a reloading-aware configuration builder can be
      setup and fine-tuned to an application's needs.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Combining Configuration Sources">
    <p>
      In <em>Commons Configuration</em> 1.x, there were two options for
      creating a
      <a href="howto_combinedbuilder.html#Combining_Configuration_Sources">combined
      configuration</a> out of multiple sources:
      <ul>
        <li>The already deprecated <code>ConfigurationFactory</code> class</li>
        <li>The <code>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</code> class</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The former has been removed. The functionality provided by
      <code>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</code> is still available, but the
      class has been renamed to
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/combined/CombinedConfigurationBuilder.html">
      CombinedConfigurationBuilder</a></code> (the old name was no longer
      appropriate as builders are now a common concept in the library) and
      adapted to other builder implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In version 1.x <code>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</code> inherited from
      <code>XMLConfiguration</code> - it was itself a configuration and could be
      populated dynamically. <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> in
      contrast is a regular builder implementation. In its initialization
      parameters it can be passed another builder object from which the
      definition for the combined configuration is obtained. So a dynamic
      approach is possible here as well. In both cases, the
      <code>getConfiguration()</code> method is used to obtain the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/CombinedConfiguration.html">
      CombinedConfiguration</a></code> object constructed by the builder. From
      a usage point of view there is not that much difference between these
      classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both the old and the version, a XML-based definition file is used to
      declare the different configuration sources that are to be combined plus
      some additional settings. The principle structure of this file has not
      changed - the full description of the new format is available at
      <a href="howto_combinedbuilder.html#Configuration_definition_file_reference">Configuration
      definition file reference</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A problem when migrating from <code>DefaultConfigurationBuilder</code> to
      <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> is that those definition files
      can contain <a href="howto_beans.html">bean definitions</a>, i.e. references
      to classes which will be automatically instantiated by <em>Commons
      Configuration</em>. Because of the change of the package name definition files
      written for version 1.x will not work with the new version if they make
      use of this feature and reference internal classes shipped with the
      library. Here the fully-qualified class names in definition files have to
      be adapted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prominent example of bean definitions were reloading strategies assigned
      to specific configuration sources. As the whole reloading mechanism has
      changed significantly, such declarations are no longer supported. There is
      a much simpler replacement: just add the <em>config-reload</em> attribute
      to a configuration source declaration to enable reloading support for this
      source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another incompatible change is related to the extensibility of the
      definition file format. It used to be possible - and still is - to define
      custom tags for declaring special configuration sources. This is done by
      registering provider objects at the configuration builder. Because the
      internal implementation of <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code> is
      very different from the old one, this also affects the interface used for
      providers. The main difference is that providers for the old version used
      to create configuration objects directly, while the new providers create
      configuration builders. If custom providers have been used in the past,
      additional migration effort has to be planned in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete description of <code>CombinedConfigurationBuilder</code>, its
      usage and supported extension points can be found in chapter
      <a href="howto_combinedbuilder.html">Combining Configuration Sources</a>
      of the user's guide.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Concurrency Issues">
    <p>
      An important design goal of <em>Commons Configuration</em> 2.0 was to
      improve the behavior of configuration objects when accessed by multiple
      threads. In the 1.x series, support for concurrent access to configuration
      data has grown historically: The original intent was that a configuration
      object can be read by multiple threads in a safe way, but as soon as one
      thread modifies the data, the user has to ensure proper synchronization
      manually. Later on, also due to the reloading implementation, more and
      more synchronization was added. This even caused performance bottlenecks,
      for instance as reported in
      <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CONFIGURATION-530">CONFIGURATION-530</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The changes in version 2.0 related to multi-threading include multiple
      aspects. The most obvious change is probably that synchronization of
      configurations is now much more flexible. A configuration instance is
      assigned a
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/sync/Synchronizer.html">
      Synchronizer</a></code> object which controls if and how locks are obtained
      when executing operations on this configuration. By changing the
      synchronizer, an application can adapt the locking behavior to its specific
      needs. For instance, if a configuration is only accessed by a single
      thread, there is no need for any synchronization. Typical usage modes are
      reflected by different default implementations of the
      <code>Synchronizer</code> interface:
      <ul>
        <li><code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/sync/NoOpSynchronizer.html">
        NoOpSynchronizer</a></code> does not use any synchronization at all.
        This is the option of choice for single-threaded access, but fails in a
        multi-threaded environment.</li>
        <li><code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/sync/ReadWriteSynchronizer.html">
        ReadWriteSynchronizer</a></code> implements synchronization based on a
        read/write lock.</li>
      </ul>
      Note that the default option is <code>NoOpSynchronizer</code>. This means
      that configuration objects are not thread-safe per default! You have to
      change the synchronizer in order to make them safe for concurrent access.
      This can be done for instance by using a builder which is configured
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking about builders: This is another concept which supports access to
      configuration data by multiple threads. Access to a builder is always
      thread-safe. By shifting the responsibility for reloading operations from
      the configuration to the builder, the need for intensive locking on each
      property access could be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hierarchical configurations derived from
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/BaseHierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      BaseHierarchicalConfiguration</a></code> now use a new implementation
      which allows for concurrent access without locking. So this group of
      configurations can be used without having to set a fully-functional
      synchronizer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some other changes on classes with the goal to make them
      well-behaving citizens in a concurrent environment. This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Some classes have been made immutable, passing all information to the
        constructor rather than using bean-style properties for their
        initialization. An example is
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/DefaultExpressionEngine.html">
        DefaultExpressionEngine</a></code> whose instances can now be shared between
        different hierarchical configuration objects.</li>
        <li>Static utility classes with state have been rewritten so that they
        can be instantiated. Mutable static fields are in general
        thread-hostile. Refer to
        <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CONFIGURATION-486">CONFIGURATION-486</a>
        for further details.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please refer to <a href="howto_concurrency.html">Configurations and
      Concurrent Access</a> for a full description of this complex topic.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Events">
    <p>
      Another area in which major changes took place is the support for
      <a href="howto_events.html">event notifications</a>. <em>Commons
      Configuration</em> 1.x had two types of event listeners for configuration
      update events and error events. Version 2.0 adds some more event sources -
      events generated by configuration builders and reloading events. Despite
      this increased number of event sources, there is now only a single event
      listener interface
      (<code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/event/EventListener.html">
      EventListener</a></code>), and the mechanisms for adding and removing event
      listeners are the same everywhere; the basic protocol is defined by the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/event/EventSource.html">
      EventSource</a></code> interface. (Note that <code>EventSource</code> used
      to be a class in version 1.x; it actually was the base class of
      <code>AbstractConfiguration</code> and therefore inherited by all concrete
      configuration implementations. In version 2.0 this role has been taken
      over by the <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/event/BaseEventSource.html">
      BaseEventSource</a></code> class.)
    </p>
    <p>
      While the old version used numeric constants to define specific event types,
      the new events are classified by instances of the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/event/EventType.html">
      EventType</a></code> class. Event types can be used to determine the
      semantic meaning of an event, but also for filtering for specific events.
      They stand in a logic hierarchical relation with each other; an event
      listener that is registered for a base event type also receives notifications
      for derived types. This makes a flexible and fine-grained event processing
      possible. The whole event mechanism is very similar to the one implemented
      in JavaFX.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most basic use case for event listeners in version 1.x was probably
      the registration of a change listener at a single configuration instance.
      To achieve an equivalent effect with the new API, one would implement an
      event listener and register it for the event type
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/event/ConfigurationEvent.html#ANY">
      ConfigurationEvent.ANY</a></code>. This listener will then receive
      notifications for all kinds of updates performed on the monitored
      configuration. Structure and content of these events is nearly
      identical to the counterparts in version 1.x.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, an important difference with the event listener
      registration: The recommended way is to add the listener to the
      <a href="#Creating_Configurations">configuration builder</a> which
      creates the configuration rather than to the configuration itself. This
      ensures that registration is done at the correct moment in time and also
      updated when the builder decides to replace its managed configuration
      instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all the new event mechanism should be much more flexible and
      powerful than the old one.
