            <subsection name="CVE-2022-33980 prior to 2.8.0, RCE when applied to untrusted input">
                <p>
                    On 2022-07-06, the Apache Commons Configuration team disclosed
                    <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-33980">CVE-2022-33980</a>
                    . Key takeaways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you rely on software that uses a version of commons-configuration prior to 2.8.0, you are likely
                            still not vulnerable: only if this software loads configuration
                            files from untrusted sources, which is likely rare.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your own software uses commons-configuration, double-check whether it loads
                            configuration files from untrusted sources. If so, an update to 2.8.0 could be a
                            quick workaround, but the recommended solution is to also properly validate and sanitize the
                            untrusted input.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apache Commons Configuration is a library to read configuration data from a variety of sources.
                    It supports variable interpolation with lookups using various mechanisms, such as system properties
                    or environment variables. Some of the available interpolators can trigger network
                    access or code execution. This is intended, but it also means an application that includes user
                    input in the configuration passed to Commons Configuration without properly sanitizing it would allow an
                    attacker to trigger those interpolators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For that reason the Apache Commons Configuration team have decided to update the list of interpolators
                    that are enabled by default to be more
                    conservative, so that the impact of a failure to validate inputs is mitigated and will not
                    give an attacker access to these interpolators. However, it is still recommended that users treat
                    untrusted input with care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're not currently aware of any applications that load untrusted input as configuration
                    and thus would have been impacted by this problem prior to Apache Commons Configuration 2.8.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue is different from
                    <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#log4j-2.15.0">Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)</a>
                    because in Log4Shell, string interpolation was possible from the log message body, which commonly
                    contains untrusted input. In the Apache Common Configuration issue, the processed configuration data
                    is much less likely to come from an untrusted source.
