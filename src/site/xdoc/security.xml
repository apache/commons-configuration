                    The <a href="https://commons.apache.org/security.html#Security_Model">Apache Commons security model</a>
                    specifies that it is unsafe to pass possibly malicious input to Commons libraries.
                    For Commons Configuration 2.x, loading untrusted configuration files or performing operations
                    on them should not allow code execution, and should not cause any denial of service situations.
                    'Denial of service' here means causing resource usage disproportionate to the input size.

            <subsection name="CVE-2022-33980 prior to 2.8.0, RCE when applied to untrusted input">
                <p>
                    On 2022-07-06, the Apache Commons Configuration team disclosed
                    <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-33980">CVE-2022-33980</a>
                    . Key takeaways:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you rely on software that uses a version of commons-configuration before 2.8.0, you are likely
                            still not vulnerable: only if this software loads configuration
                            files from untrusted sources, which is likely rare.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your software uses Commons Configuration, double-check whether it loads
                            configuration files from untrusted sources. If so, an update to 2.8.0 could be a
                            quick workaround, but the recommended solution is to validate and sanitize
                            untrusted input.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Apache Commons Configuration is a library that reads configuration data from many sources.
                    It supports variable interpolation with lookups using various mechanisms, such as system properties
                    or environment variables. Some of the available interpolators can trigger network
                    access or code execution. This is intended, but it also means an application that includes user
                    input in the configuration passed to Commons Configuration without properly sanitizing it would allow an
                    attacker to trigger those interpolators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For that reason, the Apache Commons Configuration team decided to update the list of interpolators
                    enabled by default to be more conservative, so that the impact of a failure to validate inputs is mitigated and will not
                    give an attacker access to these interpolators. However, it is still recommended that users treat
                    untrusted input with care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're not currently aware of any applications that load untrusted input as configuration
                    and thus would have been impacted by this problem before Apache Commons Configuration 2.8.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue is different from
                    <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#log4j-2.15.0">Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)</a>
                    because in Log4Shell, string interpolation was possible from the log message body, which commonly
                    contains untrusted input. In the Apache Common Configuration issue, the processed configuration data
                    is much less likely to come from an untrusted source.

             <subsection name="CVE-2024-29131 prior to 2.10.1, Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability">
               <p>
                 On 2024-03-20, the Apache Commons Configuration team disclosed <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29131">CVE-2024-29131</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                 This Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration affects Apache Commons Configuration: from 2.0 before 2.10.1.
                 Users can see this as a <code>StackOverflowError</code> when adding a property in <code>AbstractListDelimiterHandler.flattenIterator()</code>.
                 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.1, which fixes the issue. 
                 The details are in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CONFIGURATION-840">CONFIGURATION-840</a>.

                 This Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration affects Apache Commons Configuration: from 2.0 before 2.10.1.
                 Users can see this as a <code>StackOverflowError</code> calling <code>ListDelimiterHandler.flatten(Object, int)</code> with a cyclical object tree.
                 Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.1, which fixes the issue.
