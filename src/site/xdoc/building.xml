            Commons Configuration uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> as its build tool.
            Any recent version of Maven should work. To build the Configuration
            jar, change into the directory where the source distribution resides and run
            "mvn install". This will compile the source and tests, run the tests, and then
            package the jar. The jar will also be copied into the local maven repository
            for use by other builds. According to the minimum Java version of
            Commons Configuration, this build requires a JDK 1.6 or higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build the web site run "mvn site". When it completes the web site will reside in
            the target/site directory and may be viewed by opening target/site/index.html.
            Note that due to a dependency to a maven reporting plugin, the build of the site
            requires JDK 1.7 or higher.

            <code>TestWebdavConfigurationBuilder</code> is a functional test that tests
            DefaultConfigurationBuilder with the configuration files stored in a WebDAV
            server. To run the test, execute the steps that follow
            <ol>
              <li>Copy all the files in the conf directory to the WebDAV server. Not all the
              files are required but it is generally easier to use a tool like cadaver
              and do an mput than try to copy the required files individually.</li>
              <li>Add the following to the profiles section of settings.xml in the Maven home
              directory. Modify the urls to match your setup.
<source><![CDATA[
   <profile>
    <profile>
      <id>webdav</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <test.webdav.base>webdav://vfsusr:vfstest@192.168.10.133:80/conf</test.webdav.base>
      </properties>
    </profile>]]></source></li>
              <li>run "mvn -P webdav test -Dtest=TestWebdavConfigurationBuilder". The test
              can also be run using "mvn -P webdav test" but this will run all the unit tests
              in addition to the WebDAV test.</li>
