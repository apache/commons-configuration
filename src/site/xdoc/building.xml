            Commons Configuration uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> as its build tool.
            Any recent version of Maven should work. To build the Configuration
            jar, change into the directory where the source distribution resides and run
            "mvn install". This will compile the source and tests, run the tests, and then
            package the jar. The jar will also be copied into the local maven repository
            for use by other builds. According to the minimum Java version of
            Commons Configuration, this build requires a JDK 8 or higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build the web site run "mvn site". When it completes the web site will reside in
            the target/site directory and may be viewed by opening target/site/index.html.
