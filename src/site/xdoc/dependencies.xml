        <section name="Runtime dependencies for Commons Configuration">

            <p>
              Commons Configuration requires Java 8 or later.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of dependencies are declared in the Maven POM. These are all
              needed during compile time. On runtime however you only need to
              add the dependencies to your classpath that are required by the
              parts of the Commons Configuration package you are using. The
              following table helps you to determine which dependencies you
              have to include based on the components you intend to use:
            </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Commons Configuration makes use of other
                Commons components. You should be able to use the current
                versions of these components together with Commons Configuration.
                In some cases, when no specific features are used, older
                versions will work, too.</li> 
                <li>See pom.xml for versions used to build and test this version.</li>
