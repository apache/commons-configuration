    <section name="Properties files">
      <p>
        Properties files are a popular mean of configuring applications. Of course Commons Configuration
        supports this format and enhance significantly the basic <code>java.util.Properties</code> class.
        This section introduces the features of the  <code>PropertiesConfiguration</code> class.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Loading">
        <p>
          At first lets consider that the whole configuration data of an application consists in
          a single properties file named <code>usergui.properties</code> with the following content:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
# Properties definining the GUI
colors.background = #FFFFFF
]]></source>

        <p>
          To load this file, you'll write:
        </p>
<source>
Configuration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
</source>
        <p>
          If you do not specify an absolute path, the file will be searched automatically
          in the following locations:
          <ul>
            <li>in the current directory</li>
            <li>in the user home directory</li>
            <li>in the classpath</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of using a constructor that takes a file name you can also
          invoke one of the <code>load()</code> methods. There are several
          overloaded variants that allow to load properties from
          <ul>
            <li>a file, specified by either a path or a <code>java.io.File</code>
            object</li>
            <li>a URL</li>
            <li>an input stream or a reader.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the <code>load()</code> methods do not empty the
          configuration before new data is loaded. This makes it easy to
          construct union configurations by simply calling <code>load()</code>
          multiple times. But if you want to reuse a <code>Configuration</code>
          object and load a different file, remember to call the
          <code>clear()</code> method first to ensure that old properties are
          wiped out.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Includes">
        <p>
          If a property is named "<code>include</code>" and the value of that property is the
          name of a file on the disk, that file will be included into the configuration. Here is
          an example:
        </p>
<source>
# usergui.properties

include = colors.properties
include = sizes.properties
</source>

<source>
# colors.properties

colors.background = #FFFFFF
</source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Automatic Reloading">
        <p>
          A common issue with properties file is to handle the reloading of the file when it
          changes. Typically you would use a thread monitoring the date of the file and reloading
          the <code>Properties</code> when a more recent date is detected. Commons Configuration
          integrates this mechanism out of the box, to enable it, just specify a reloading strategy
          on your configuration:
        </p>
<source>
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
config.setReloadingStrategy(new FileChangedReloadingStrategy());
</source>
        <p>
          Now everytime you edit manually the <code>usergui.properties</code> file, the
          configuration is automatically refreshed and the modified values are immediately
          available to your application.
        </p>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Saving">
        <p>
          To save your configuration, just call the <code>save()</code> method:
        </p>
<source>
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
config.setProperty("colors.background", "#000000);
config.save();
</source>
        <p>
          You can also save a copy of the configuration to another file:
        </p>
<source>
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
config.setProperty("colors.background", "#000000);
config.save("usergui.backup.properties);
</source>
        <p>
          And if you don't want to bother saving your configuration everytime it changes,
          you can enable the automatic saving mode:
        </p>
<source>
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("usergui.properties");
config.setAutoSave(true);
config.setProperty("colors.background", "#000000); // the configuration is saved after this call
</source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Lists and arrays">
        <p>
          Commons Configuration has the ability to return easily a list of values,
          for example if your file contains a list of comma separated values:
        </p>
<source>
# chart colors
colors.pie = #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF
</source>
        <p>
          You don't have to split the value manually, you can retrieve an array directly with:
        </p>
<source>
String[] colors = config.getStringArray("colors.pie");
</source>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you can specify a list of values in your properties file by using
          the same key on several lines:
        </p>
<source>
# chart colors
colors.pie = #FF0000;
colors.pie = #00FF00;
colors.pie = #0000FF;
</source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Variable Interpolation">
        <p>
          If you are familiar with Ant or Maven, you have most certainly already encountered
          the variables (like <code>${token}</code>) that are automatically expanded when the
          configuration file is loaded. Commons Configuration supports this feature as well,
          here is an example:
        </p>
<source>
application.name = Killer App
application.version = 1.6.2

application.title = ${application.name} ${application.version}
</source>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Special Characters">
        <p>
          If you need a special character in a property like a line feed, a tabulation or
          an unicode character, you can specify it with the same escaped notation used for
          Java Strings. The list separator ("," by default), can also be escaped:
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
key = This \n string \t contains \, escaped \\ characters \u0020
]]></source>
      </subsection>
