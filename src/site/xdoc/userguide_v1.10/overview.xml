    <section name="Using Configuration">
      <p>
        Commons Configuration allows you to access configuration properties from
        a variety of different sources. No matter if they are stored in a properties file,
        a XML document, or a JNDI tree, they can all be accessed in the same way
        through the generic <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></code>
        interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another strength of Commons Configuration is its ability to mix configurations
        from heterogeneous sources and treat them like a single logic configuration.
        This section will introduce you to the different configurations
        available and will show you how to combine them.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Configuration Sources">
      <p>
        Currently there are quite a number of different sources of Configuration objects. But,
        by just using a Configuration object versus a specific type like XMLConfiguration or
        JNDIConfiguration, you are sheltered from the mechanics of actually retrieving the
        configuration values. These various sources include:
        <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>PropertiesConfiguration</strong>
              Loads configuration values from a properties file.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>XMLConfiguration</strong>
              Takes values from an XML document.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>INIConfiguration</strong>
              Loads the values from a .ini file as used by Windows.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>PropertyListConfiguration</strong>
              Loads values from an OpenStep .plist file. XMLPropertyListConfiguration is also
              available to read the XML variant used by Mac OS X.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>JNDIConfiguration</strong>
              Using a key in the JNDI tree, can retrieve values as configuration properties.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>BaseConfiguration</strong>
              An in-memory method of populating a Configuration object.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>HierarchicalConfiguration</strong>
              An in-memory Configuration object that is able to deal with complex
              structured data.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>SystemConfiguration</strong>
              A configuration using the system properties
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>ConfigurationConverter</strong>
              Takes a java.util.Properties or an org.apache.commons.collections.ExtendedProperties
              and converts it to a Configuration object.
          </li>
       </ul>

      <subsection name="Mixing Configuration Sources">
      <p>
        Often you want to provide a base set of configuration values, but allow the user to easily
        override them for their specific environment.  Well one way is to hard code the default
        values into your code, and have then provide a property file that overrides this.  However,
        this is a very rigid way of doing things. Instead, with the <code>CompositeConfiguration</code>
        you can provide many different ways of setting up a configuration. You can either do it
        manually:
      </p>

<source>
CompositeConfiguration config = new CompositeConfiguration();
config.addConfiguration(new SystemConfiguration());
config.addConfiguration(new PropertiesConfiguration("application.properties"));
</source>

      <p>or via the <code>ConfigurationFactory</code> class:</p>

<source>
ConfigurationFactory factory = new ConfigurationFactory("config.xml");
Configuration config = factory.getConfiguration();
</source>

      <p>
        The <code>config.xml</code> file used in the example above is a configuration descriptor,
        it specifies the Configuration objects to load. Here is an example of descriptor:
      </p>

<source><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>

<configuration>
  <system/>
  <properties fileName="application.properties"/>
</configuration>
]]></source>

      <p>
        What this says is that we are loading up all system properties, as well as the properties
        file <code>application.properties</code>. The order of precedence is first to last. So in
        the above example, if a property is not found in the system properties, it'll be searched
        in the properties file. This allows you to set up default values in a properties file, and
        override them with the system properties.
      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="The Configuration interface">
      <p>
        All the classes in this package that represent different kinds of configuration
        sources share a single interface:
        <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></code>.
        This interface allows you to access and manipulate configuration properties
        in a generic way.
      </p>
      <p>
        A major part of the methods defined in the <code>Configuration</code>
        interface deals with retrieving properties of different data types. All
        these methods take a key as an argument that points to the desired
        property. This is a string value whose exact meaning depends on the
        concrete <code>Configuration</code> implementation used. They try to
        find the property specified by the passed in key and convert it to their
        target type; this converted value will be returned. There are also
        overloaded variants of all methods that allow to specify a default value,
        which will be returned if the property cannot be found. The following
        data types are supported:
        <ul>
          <li>BigDecimal</li>
          <li>BigInteger</li>
          <li>boolean</li>
          <li>byte</li>
          <li>double</li>
          <li>float</li>
          <li>int</li>
          <li>long</li>
          <li>short</li>
          <li>String</li>
        </ul>
        The names of these methods start with <code>get</code> followed by their
        data type. The <code>getString()</code> method for instance will return
        String values, <code>getInt()</code> will operate on integers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properties can have multiple values, so it is also possible to query a
        list containing all of the available values. This is done using the
        <code>getList()</code> method.
      </p>
      <p>
        For manipulating properties or their values the following methods can
        be used:
        <dl>
          <dt><code>addProperty()</code></dt>
          <dd>Adds a new property to the configuration. If this property already
          exists, another value is added to it (so it becomes a multi-valued
          property).</dd>
          <dt><code>clearProperty()</code></dt>
          <dd>Removes the specified property from the configuration.</dd>
          <dt><code>setProperty()</code></dt>
          <dd>Overwrites the value of the specified property. This is the same
          as removing the property and then calling <code>addProperty()</code>
          with the new property value.</dd>
          <dt><code>clear()</code></dt>
          <dd>Wipes out the whole configuration</dd>
        </dl>
      </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Threading issues">
      <p>
        The most concrete implementations of the <code>Configuration</code>
        interface that are shipped with this library are not thread-safe.
        They can be accessed concurrently in a read-only manner. However if one
        thread modifies a configuration object, manual synchronization has to be
        performed to ensure correctness of data. Notes about the thread
        safety of concrete implementation classes can be found in the Javadocs
        for these classes.
