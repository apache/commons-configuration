    <section name="Composite Configuration Details">
        <p>
            There are many use cases when you want to collect the properties
            of several configuration sources and access them like a single
            configuration object. One way to do that is using the
            <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/CompositeConfiguration.html">
            CompositeConfiguration</a></code> class.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <code>CompositeConfiguration</code> object contains a list of
            other configuration objects. When properties are accessed from a
            composite configuration the object takes the passed in property key
            and iterates over the list of the contained configurations. As soon
            as a value is found for the key it is returned. This means that a
            <code>CompositeConfiguration</code> implements a kind of override
            semantics, i.e. the properties of configurations that were added
            first hide the property values of configurations added later.
        </p>
    	<p>
    		We will discuss how you can establish a "default" choice for your
    		Composite Configuration as well as save changes made to your
    		Composite Configuration.
    	</p>
    	<subsection name="Setting Up Defaults">
    		<p>
    			Defaults are very simple.  You can just add them as your last configuration object, 
    			either through the ConfigurationFactory or manually:
    		</p>
    			<source><![CDATA[
Configuration defaults = new PropertiesConfiguration(fileToDefaults);
Configuration otherProperties = new PropertiesConfiguration(fileToOtherProperties);
CompositeConfiguration cc = new CompositeConfiguration();
cc.addConfiguration(otherProperties);
cc.addConfiguration(fileToDefaults);
]]></source>
		</subsection>
		
		<subsection name="Saving Changes">
			<p>
				If you have a non static Configuration where you want to 
				save changes made to a configuration, and you are using a
				CompositeConfiguration, then you will need to pass into
				the constructor of the CompositeConfiguration what Configuration
				to save the changes via.
			</p>
    			<source><![CDATA[
PropertiesConfiguration saveConfiguration = new PropertiesConfiguration(fileToSaveChangesIn);
Configuration cc = new CompositeConfiguration(saveConfiguration);
cc.setProperty("newProperty","new value");

saveConfiguration.save();
]]></source>
			<p>
				Alternatively, you can just request the
				in-memory configuration that stores the changes. The following
                example fragment copies all properties from the in-memory
                configuration into a <code>DatabaseConfiguration</code>, so
                that they are made persistent:
    			<source><![CDATA[
Configuration changes = myCompositeConfiguration.getInMemoryConfiguration();
DatabaseConfiguration config = new DatabaseConfiguration(datasource, "configuration", "key", "value");
for (Iterator<String> i = changes.getKeys(); i.hasNext()){
	String key = i.next();
	Object value = changes.get(key);
	config.setProperty(key,value);
}
]]></source>
			</p>
