	<section name="Utility classes and Tips and Tricks">
    <p>
      In this section some utility classes will be introduced that can be used
      to make handling of configuration objects easier. These classes already
      provide solutions for some often occurring problems. We will list these
      problems in no specific order and show how they can be solved with
      classes provided by <em>Commons Configuration</em>.
    </p>

    <subsection name="Copy a configuration">
	<p>
      Often it is required to copy the data of one <code>Configuration</code>
      object into another one. For this purpose the
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/AbstractConfiguration.html">
      AbstractConfiguration</a></code> class (which serves as the base class for
      most of the configuration implementations shipped with this library)
      provides two methods implementing a basic copy operation:
      <ul>
        <li><code>append()</code> takes the configuration to be copied
        as argument and adds all of its properties to the current configuration.</li>
        <li><code>copy()</code> is very similar to <code>append()</code>. The
        difference is that properties that already exist in the target
        configuration are replaced by the properties of the source configuration.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      These methods work fine if the target configuration is not a hierarchical
      configuration. If a hierarchical configuration is to be copied into
      another one, the methods are not able to handle the hierarchical
      structure; so the resulting configuration will contain all of the
      properties of the source configuration, but the specific parent-child
      relations will probably be lost. If a hierarchical configuration needs to
      be copied, there are the following options:
      <ul>
        <li>The <code>clone()</code> method can be used to create a copy of a
        hierarchical configuration. This also works for non-hierarchical
        configurations. Most of the configuration implementations provided by
        <em>Commons Configurations</em> support cloning. The
        <code>cloneConfiguration()</code> method of
        <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/ConfigurationUtils.html">
        ConfigurationUtils</a></code> can be used for creating a copy of an
        arbitrary <code>Configuration</code> object. This method checks whether
        the passed in configuration implements the <code>Cloneable</code>
        interface and, if so, invokes its <code>clone()</code> method.</li>
        <li>Most hierarchical configurations have a constructor, which takes
        another hierarchical configuration as argument. This constructor
        copies the content of the specified configuration into the newly created
        object.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Converting a flat configuration into a hierarchical one">
    <p>
      <a href="howto_xml.html">Hierarchical configurations</a> provide some
      enhanced features that are not available for &quot;flat&quot;
      configurations. For instance they support more sophisticated query
      facilities. Because of that it may be sometimes useful to transform an
      ordinary configuration into a hierarchical one. The following code
      fragment shows how this can be done:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
// Create a flat configuration
PropertiesConfiguration flatConfig = new PropertiesConfiguration();
flatConfig.load(...);
HierarchicalConfiguration hc =
  ConfigurationUtils.convertToHierarchical(flatConfig);
]]></source>
    <p>
      The <code>convertToHierarchical()</code> method of
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/ConfigurationUtils.html">
      ConfigurationUtils</a></code> checks whether the passed in object
      is already a hierarchical configuration. If this is the case, it is
      returned unchanged. Otherwise a new <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code>
      object is created, and the properties of the source configuration are
      copied into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a flat configuration contains keys with special characters
      that are not compatible with the expression engine of a hierarchical
      configuration. For instance, a properties configuration could have the
      following property:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
test(xy)=true
]]></source>
    <p>
      When processing this property during conversion the default expression
      engine of the resulting hierarchical configuration will interpret the
      brackets as an index marker and try to convert the string between the
      brackets into a number. In this example this fails with a
      <code>NumberFormatException</code>! The cause for this problem is that the
      property key contains characters with a special meaning for the default
      expression engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this problem, it is possible to specify an alternative expression
      engine that will be used for the conversion. For instance, if you know that
      your property keys can contain brackets, you could use an instance of
      <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code> that is configured with a different
      index marker. This could look as follows:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
DefaultExpressionEngine engineConvert = new DefaultExpressionEngine();
engineConvert.setIndexStart("[");
engineConvert.setIndexEnd("]");
HierarchicalConfiguration hc =
  ConfigurationUtils.convertToHierarchical(flatConfig, engineConvert);
]]></source>
    <p>
      In this example an expression engine is constructed that uses square
      brackets as index markers. Therefore normal brackets do not have a
      special meaning and thus are no more problematic during conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> When using a <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html">
      CombinedConfiguration</a> flat configurations contained in the combined
      configuration are also converted into hierarchical configurations using
      the methods discussed here. The <code>CombinedConfiguration</code> class
      defines the method <code>setConversionExpressionEngine()</code>, which
      can be called to specify an expression engine to be used during this
      conversion. The expression engine passed to this method will be
      propagated to ConfigurationUtils.convertToHierarchical().
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Converting between properties and configurations">
    <p>
      When working with the JDK the <code>java.util.Properties</code> class is
      typically used for storing configuration data. If <em>Commons
      Configuration</em> is to be integrated in such an application, there may
      be the requirement of converting from <code>Properties</code> objects to
      <code>Configuration</code> objects and vice versa. For this purpose an
      utility class can be used:
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/ConfigurationConverter.html">
      ConfigurationConverter</a></code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage of this class is pretty simple. It provides some static utility
      methods that perform different conversions. Below you can see some
      examples. In this fragment we assume that we have a method
      <code>processConfiguration()</code> that is called from older parts of an
      application that are not aware of the <em>Commons Configuration</em> API.
      So they pass in a <code>Properties</code> object and expect one as
      return value. Inside the method a temporary <code>Configuration</code>
      object is created and used.
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
/**
 * Does some processing of properties.
 * @param props the source properties
 * @return the processed properties
 */
Properties processConfiguration(Properties props)
{
    // Create a configuration for the properties for easy access
    Configuration config = ConfigurationConverter.getConfiguration(props);
    
    // Now use the Configuration API for manipulating the configuration data
    ...
    
    // Return a Properties object with the results
    return ConfigurationConverter.getProperties(config);
}
]]></source>
    <p>
      Please refer to the Javadocs of
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/ConfigurationConverter.html">
      ConfigurationConverter</a></code> to learn more about the available
      conversion methods and their limitations.
    </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Interpolation of all variables">
    <p>
      Another issue with the integration of <em>Commons Configuration</em> with
      native Java applications can be variables: Configuration implementations
      are able to detect variables like <code>${myReference}</code> or
      <code>${sys:java.version}</code> in the values of their properties and
      substitute them by their current values (see the section
      <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Variable_Interpolation">Variable
      Interpolation</a> for more details). External components probably do not
      know how to handle such placeholders when processing configuration files
      written by <em>Commons Configuration</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/AbstractConfiguration.html">
      AbstractConfiguration</a></code> provides the method
      <code>interpolatedConfiguration()</code>. This method creates a clone of
      the current configuration and then performs interpolation on all of its
      properties. So the result of this method is a configuration object with
      basically the same content as the original configuration, but with all
      variables replaced by their actual values (as far as this was possible).
      The following code fragment shows how a
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/PropertiesConfiguration.html">
      PropertiesConfiguration</a></code> object can be saved in a way that the
      resulting properties file does not contain any variables:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
// Load a properties file (which may contain variables)
PropertiesConfiguration config = new PropertiesConfiguration("config.properties");

// Perform interpolation on all variables
PropertiesConfiguration extConfig =
    (PropertiesConfiguration) config.interpolatedConfiguration();

// Save the interpolated configuration (no more variables)
extConfig.save("external_config.properties");
]]></source>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Handling of runtime exceptions">
    <p>
      Section <a href="howto_events.html#Error_listeners">Error listeners</a>
      introduces a way of dealing with runtime exceptions that can occur on
      accessing configuration properties by registering an event listener. If
      you do not want to provide a special error handler, but only need to
      propagate the exception that caused the error event, you can make use of
      a convenience method of the
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/ConfigurationUtils.html">
      ConfigurationUtils</a></code> class: <code>enableRuntimeExceptions()</code>
      registers a special error listener at the passed in configuration that
      will throw a
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/ConfigurationRuntimeException.html">
      ConfigurationRuntimeException</a></code> exception for each received
      error event. The following code fragment shows an example of using this
      method:
    </p>
    <source><![CDATA[
JNDIConfiguration config = new JNDIConfiguration();
ConfigurationUtils.enableRuntimeExceptions(config);

// This may now throw a ConfigurationRuntimeException
String value = config.getString("myKey");
]]></source>
    <p>
      <code>enableRuntimeExceptions()</code> can be called for all
      <code>Configuration</code> implementations that are derived from
      <code><a href="../javadocs/v1.10/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/event/EventSource.html">
      EventSource</a></code> (which is the case for almost all configuration
      classes provided by this library). Of course the affected implementation
      must support the mechanism of error events, otherwise the registered
      listener will not be triggered. In
      <a href="howto_events.html#Error_listeners">Error listeners</a> more
      information can be found.
