# A properties file to test the compatibility of
# PropertiesConfiguration.JupIOFactory to java.util.Properties (JUP).
# Test cases in here don't necessarily indicate that the DefaultIOFactory

# Spaces can be escaped using "\". Important for the first leading space in a
# property value so it won't get trimmed. "\u0020" is too cumbersome.
leadingSpace = \  abc

# Trailing spaces are preserved.

# For unknown escape sequences, the backslash will simply be removed.
# Technically "\ " is also an unknown escape sequence; but it's enough to avoid
# leading whitespace in values from being trimmed.

# DefaultIOFactory would interpret this as a line continuation (because of the
# trailing whitespace being trimmed). For JUP this is just an escaped space.

# comment line.

# When continuing a property line, leading whitespace of the following lines is
# trimmed; just like the whitespace between the separator and the first
# non-whitespace character of the property value.
