        FileHandlerReloadingDetector now has a new refresh() method to
        initialize the reloading state from the underlying file. This new
        method is called by DefaultReloadingDetectorFactory when a new detector
        instance is created. This makes sure that a changed configuration file
        is directly detected on the first invocation of the
        isReloadingRequired() method.

        handling of escape sequences in a way closer to java.util.Properties.

        as elements.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="fix" issue="CONFIGURATION-687">
        Fixed a memory leak in CombinedConfigurationBuilder. Builder for the
        child sources were created each time a new result configuration was
        requested; thus the list with child builders got longer and longer.
        This also had an impact on reloading because unnecessary reloading
        operations could be triggered. Now it is guaranteed that child builders
        are created only once.

        by converting them to string.
      </action>
      <action dev="oheger" type="add" issue="CONFIGURATION-692">
        ConversionExceptions thrown when accessing the properties of a
        configuration now contain the original cause of the exception.

        The visibility of DefaultConfigurationBuilder.XMLConfigurationProvider

        When converting a flat configuration to a hierarchical one it is now
        possible to specify the expression engine to be used for this purpose.
        This may be necessary if the flat configuration contains keys with
        special characters interpreted by the expression engine.
        CombinedConfiguration defines the new setConversionExpressionEngine()

        This may be necessary for correctly processing attributes containing

        AbstractFileConfiguration now overrides addProperty() and setProperty()
        instead of addPropertyDirect() to implement the auto save feature.
        This was necessary to properly integrate PropertiesConfigurationLayout.
        It has also the advantage that an auto save is triggered only once if
        multi-valued properties are involved (before a save operation was
