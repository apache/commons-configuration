     * This implementation maps {@code PUBLICID}'s to URLs (from which the resource will be loaded). A common use case for
     * this method is to register local URLs (possibly computed at runtime by a class loader) for DTDs and Schemas. This

     * processed XML document is local. This implementation provides only basic functionality. If more sophisticated
     * features are required, either calling {@code XMLConfiguration.setDocumentBuilder(DocumentBuilder)} to set a custom
     * {@code DocumentBuilder} (which also can be initialized with a custom {@code EntityResolver}) or creating a custom
     * entity resolver and registering it with the XMLConfiguration is recommended.
