/**
 * <p>
 * This package contains interfaces and classes related to data type conversions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An {@code AbstractConfiguration} object is associated with an object responsible for data type conversions. Each
 * conversion is done by this object. By replacing the default conversion handler by a custom version, client
 * applications can adapt and extend the type conversions available.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Related to data type conversion is also the topic of list delimiter parsing and splitting; before a string value can
 * be converted to a target data type, it must be clear whether it is to be interpreted as a single value or as a list
 * containing multiple values. In this package there are classes implementing different strategies for list delimiter
 * handling. Client code can choose the one which is most suitable for the current use case.
 * </p>
