/**
 * <p>
 * The default implementation of the {@code ListDelimiterHandler} interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class supports list splitting and delimiter escaping using a delimiter character that can be specified when
 * constructing an instance. Splitting of strings works by scanning the input for the list delimiter character. The list
 * delimiter character can be escaped by a backslash. So, provided that a comma is configured as list delimiter, in the
 * example {@code val1,val2,val3} three values are recognized. In {@code 3\,1415} the list delimiter is escaped so that
 * only a single element is detected. (Note that when writing these examples in Java code, each backslash has to be
 * doubled. This is also true for all other examples in this documentation.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because the backslash has a special meaning as escaping character it is always treated in a special way. If it occurs
 * as a normal character in a property value, it has to be escaped using another backslash (similar to the rules of the
 * Java programming language). The following example shows the correct way to define windows network shares:
 * {@code \\\\Server\\path}. Note that each backslash is doubled. When combining the list delimiter with backslashes the
 * same escaping rules apply. For instance, in {@code C:\\Temp\\,D:\\data\\} the list delimiter is recognized; it is not
 * escaped by the preceding backslash because this backslash is itself escaped. In contrast,
 * {@code C:\\Temp\\\,D:\\data\\} defines a single element with a comma being part of the value; two backslashes after
 * {@code Temp} result in a single one, the third backslash escapes the list delimiter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As can be seen, there are some constellations which are a bit tricky and cause a larger number of backslashes in
 * sequence. Nevertheless, the escaping rules are consistent and do not cause ambiguous results.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation node: An instance of this class can safely be shared between multiple {@code Configuration} instances.
 * </p>
