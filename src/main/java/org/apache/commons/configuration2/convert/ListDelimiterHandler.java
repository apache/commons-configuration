/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface that controls the handling of list delimiters in configuration properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link org.apache.commons.configuration2.AbstractConfiguration AbstractConfiguration} supports list delimiters in
 * property values. If such a delimiter is found, the value actually contains multiple values and has to be split. This
 * is useful for instance for {@link org.apache.commons.configuration2.PropertiesConfiguration PropertiesConfiguration}:
 * properties files that have to be compatible with the {@code java.util.Properties} class cannot have multiple
 * occurrences of a single property key, therefore a different storage scheme for multi-valued properties is needed. A
 * possible storage scheme could look as follows:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * myProperty=value1,value2,value3
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here a comma is used as list delimiter. When parsing this property (and using a corresponding
 * {@code ListDelimiterHandler} implementation) the string value is split, and three values are added for the property
 * key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@code ListDelimiterHandler} knows how to parse and to escape property values. It is called by concrete
 * {@code Configuration} implementations when they have to deal with properties with multiple values.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 2.0
