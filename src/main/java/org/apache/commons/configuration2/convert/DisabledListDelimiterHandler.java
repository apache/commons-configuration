 * A specialized implementation of the {@code ListDelimiterHandler} interface which disables list splitting.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class does not recognize any list delimiters; passed in strings are returned unchanged. Also the
 * {@code escape()} method is a dummy - there is no need for escaping delimiter characters as none are supported. Note
 * that the method for escaping a list throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. If list delimiters are not
 * supported, there is no point in squashing multiple values into a single one.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: An instance of this class can be shared between multiple configuration objects. It is state-less
 * and thread-safe.
