/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface for bean factories.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Beans defined in configuration files are not directly created, but by so called <em>bean factories</em>. This
 * additional level of indirection provides for high flexibility in the creation process. For instance one
 * implementation of this interface could be very simple and create a new instance of the specified class for each
 * invocation. A different implementation could cache already created beans and ensure that always the same bean of the
 * given class will be returned - this would be an easy mean for creating singleton objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The interface itself is quite simple. There is a single method for creating a bean of a given class. All necessary
 * parameters are obtained from a passed in {@link BeanCreationContext} object. It is also possible (but optional) for a
 * bean factory to declare the default class of the bean it creates. Then it is not necessary to specify a bean class in
 * the bean declaration.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.3
