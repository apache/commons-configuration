 * This interface defines methods for querying and setting the {@code Synchronizer}. In addition, it is possible to lock
 * the object for a certain operation. This is useful if some complex operations are to be performed on the
 * {@code SynchronizerSupport} object in an atomic way.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the actual effect of these methods depends on the concrete {@code Synchronizer} implementation in use! If
 * only a dummy {@code Synchronizer} is involved (which is appropriate if objects are only accessed by a single thread),
 * locking an object does not really prohibit concurrent access.
