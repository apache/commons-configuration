/**

 * An implementation of the {@code Synchronizer} interface which does not perform any synchronization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is the option of choice for applications that do not access configuration concurrently. All methods
 * required by the {@code Synchronizer} interface are just empty dummies. Therefore, this class does not have any
 * synchronization overhead. Of course, configurations using this {@code Synchronizer} implementation are not
 * thread-safe!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: This class is an enumeration because only a single instance needs to exist. This instance can be
 * shared between arbitrary configurations.
