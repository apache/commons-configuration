/**

 * A simple data class used by {@link ExpressionEngine} to store the results of the {@code prepareAdd()} operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a new property is to be added to a configuration, the affected {@code Configuration} object must know, where in
 * its hierarchy of configuration nodes new elements have to be added. This information is obtained by an
 * {@code ExpressionEngine} object that interprets the key of the new property. This expression engine will pack all
 * information necessary for the configuration to perform the add operation in an instance of this class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Information managed by this class contains:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>the configuration node, to which new elements must be added</li>
 * <li>the name of the new node</li>
 * <li>whether the new node is a child node or an attribute node</li>
 * <li>if a whole branch is to be added at once, the names of all nodes between the parent node (the target of the add
 * operation) and the new node</li>
 * </ul>
