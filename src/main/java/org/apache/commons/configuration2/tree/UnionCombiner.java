/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized implementation of the {@code NodeCombiner} interface
 * that constructs a union from two passed in node hierarchies.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The given source hierarchies are traversed, and their nodes are added to the
 * resulting structure. Under some circumstances two nodes can be combined
 * rather than adding both. This is the case if both nodes are single children
 * (no lists) of their parents and do not have values. The corresponding check
 * is implemented in the {@code findCombineNode()} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sometimes it is not possible for this combiner to detect whether two nodes
 * can be combined or not. Consider the following two node hierarchies:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Hierarchy 1:
 *
 * Database
 *   +--Tables
 *        +--Table
 *             +--name [users]
 *             +--fields
 *                   +--field
 *                   |    +--name [uid]
 *                   +--field
 *                   |    +--name [usrname]
 *                     ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Hierarchy 2:
 *
 * Database
 *   +--Tables
 *        +--Table
 *             +--name [documents]
 *             +--fields
 *                   +--field
 *                   |    +--name [docid]
 *                   +--field
 *                   |    +--name [docname]
 *                     ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both hierarchies contain data about database tables. Each describes a single
 * table. If these hierarchies are to be combined, the result should probably
 * look like the following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Database
 *   +--Tables
 *        +--Table
 *        |    +--name [users]
 *        |    +--fields
 *        |          +--field
 *        |          |    +--name [uid]
 *        |            ...
 *        +--Table
 *             +--name [documents]
 *             +--fields
 *                   +--field
 *                   |    +--name [docid]
 *                     ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * i.e. the {@code Tables} nodes should be combined, while the
 * {@code Table} nodes should both be added to the resulting tree. From
 * the combiner's point of view there is no difference between the
 * {@code Tables} and the {@code Table} nodes in the source trees,
 * so the developer has to help out and give a hint that the {@code Table}
 * nodes belong to a list structure. This can be done using the
 * {@code addListNode()} method; this method expects the name of a node,
 * which should be treated as a list node. So if
 * {@code addListNode("Table");} was called, the combiner knows that it
 * must not combine the {@code Table} nodes, but add it both to the
 * resulting tree.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another limitation is the handling of attributes: Attributes can only
 * have a single value. So if two nodes are to be combined which both have
 * an attribute with the same name, it is not possible to construct a
 * proper union attribute. In this case, the attribute value from the
 * first node is used.
 * </p>
