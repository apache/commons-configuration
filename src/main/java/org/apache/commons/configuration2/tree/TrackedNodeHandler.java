/**
 * <p>
 * A special {@code NodeHandler} implementation for tracked nodes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * While basic access to a tracked node works in the same way as for usual immutable nodes, there are differences for
 * other operations. For instance, the root node of the hierarchy is always the tracked node itself. Also the parent
 * mapping requires some special attention: as long as the node is not detached, the parent mapping of the model to
 * which the node belongs can be used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class inherits the major part of the {@code NodeHandler} implementation from its base class. In order to
 * implement the parent mapping, an underlying {@code NodeHandler} object has to be passed at construction time which
 * contains this information; requests for a node's parent are delegated to this handler. Further, the root node has to
 * be provided explicitly.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 2.0
