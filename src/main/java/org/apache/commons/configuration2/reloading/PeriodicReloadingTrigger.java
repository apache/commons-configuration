/**
 * <p>
 * A timer-based trigger for reloading checks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class is constructed with a reference to a {@link ReloadingController} and a period. After
 * calling the {@code start()} method a periodic task is started which calls
 * {@link ReloadingController#checkForReloading(Object)} on the associated reloading controller. This way changes on a
 * configuration source can be detected without client code having to poll actively. The {@code ReloadingController}
 * will perform its checks and generates events if it detects the need for a reloading operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Triggering of the controller can be disabled by calling the {@code stop()} method and later be resumed by calling
 * {@code start()} again. When the trigger is no more needed its {@code shutdown()} method should be called.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When creating an instance a {@code ScheduledExecutorService} can be provided which is then used by the object.
 * Otherwise, a default executor service is created and used. When shutting down this object it can be specified whether
 * the {@code ScheduledExecutorService} should be shut down, too.
 * </p>
