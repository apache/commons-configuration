/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized {@code ReloadingController} implementation which manages an
 * arbitrary number of other {@code ReloadingController} objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class can be used to handle multiple simple controllers for reload
 * operations as a single object. As a usage example consider a combined
 * configuration containing a number of configuration sources of which some
 * support reloading. In this scenario all {@code ReloadingController} instances
 * for the reloading-enabled sources can be added to a
 * {@code CombinedReloadingController}. Then by triggering the combined
 * controller a reload check is performed on all child sources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is a typical implementation of the <em>composite pattern</em>. An
 * instance is constructed with a collection of sub {@code ReloadingController}
 * objects. Its operations are implemented by delegating to all child
 * controllers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class expects the managed controller objects to be passed to the
 * constructor. From this list a defensive copy is created so that it cannot be
 * changed later on. Derived classes can override the
 * {@link #getSubControllers()} method if they need another way to handle child
 * controllers (e.g. a more dynamic way). However, they are then responsible to
 * ensure a safe access to this list in a multi-threaded environment.
 * </p>
