/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized implementation of {@code ReloadingDetector} which monitors a file specified by a {@link FileHandler}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of this class is passed a {@code FileHandler} at construction time. Each time the
 * {@code isReloadingRequired()} method is called, it checks whether the {@code FileHandler} points to a valid location.
 * If this is the case, the file's last modification time is obtained and compared with the last stored time. If it has
 * changed, a reload operation should be performed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because file I/O may be expensive it is possible to configure a refresh delay as a time in milliseconds. This is the
 * minimum interval between two checks. If the {@code isReloadingRequired()} method is called in shorter intervals, it
 * does not perform a check, but directly returns <b>false</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To initialize an instance either {@code isReloadingRequired()} or {@code reloadingPerformed()} can be called. The
 * first call of {@code isReloadingRequired} does not perform a check, but obtains the initial modification date of the
 * monitored file. {@code reloadingPerformed()} always obtains the file's modification date and stores it internally.
 * </p>

 * @since 2.0
