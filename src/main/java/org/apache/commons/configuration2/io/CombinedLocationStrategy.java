/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized implementation of a {@code FileLocationStrategy} which encapsulates an arbitrary number of
 * {@code FileLocationStrategy} objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A collection with the wrapped {@code FileLocationStrategy} objects is passed at construction time. During a
 * [{@code locate()} operation the wrapped strategies are called one after the other until one returns a non <b>null</b>
 * URL. This URL is returned. If none of the wrapped strategies is able to resolve the passed in {@link FileLocator},
 * result is <b>null</b>. This is similar to the <em>chain of responsibility</em> design pattern.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class, together with the provided concrete {@code FileLocationStrategy} implementations, offers a convenient way
 * to customize the lookup for configuration files: Just add the desired concrete strategies to a
 * {@code CombinedLocationStrategy} object. If necessary, custom strategies can be implemented if there are specific
 * requirements. Note that the order in which strategies are added to a {@code CombinedLocationStrategy} matters: sub
 * strategies are queried in the same order as they appear in the collection passed to the constructor.
 * </p>
