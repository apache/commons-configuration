/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface to be implemented by objects which know how to read and write themselves from or to a
 * character stream.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is implemented by special implementations of the {@code Configuration} interface which are associated
 * with a file. It demands only basic methods for doing I/O based on character stream objects. Based on these methods it
 * is possible to implement other methods which operate on files, file names, URLs, etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note that the methods defined by this interface are not intended to be called directly by client
 * code!</strong> Rather, they are used internally when doing I/O operations with a {@link FileHandler}. A
 * {@code FileHandler} supports additional functionality (e.g. it evaluates some additional interfaces the
 * {@code FileBased} object may implement); this functionality is not available on a direct method invocation, so this
 * may lead to unpredictable results.
 * </p>
