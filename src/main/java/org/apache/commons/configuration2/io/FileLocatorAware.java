/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface to be implemented by {@link FileBased} objects which need access to the current
 * {@link FileLocator}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When loading or saving a {@code FileBased} object using {@code FileHandler} the handler eventually invokes the
 * {@code read()} or {@code write()} methods passing in a reader or writer. For some implementations this may not be
 * sufficient because they need information about the current location. For instance, a concrete {@code FileBased}
 * implementation may have to resolve other data sources based on relative file names which have to be interpreted in
 * the context of the current file location.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To deal with such scenarios, affected implementations can choose to implement this interface. They are then passed
 * the current location to the file being accessed before their {@code read()} or {@code write()} method is called.
 * </p>
