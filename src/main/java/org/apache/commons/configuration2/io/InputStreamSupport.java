 * When reading data using a {@link FileHandler} per default a reader is used as defined by the
 * {@link FileBased#read(java.io.Reader)} method. For some configuration formats it is necessary to directly read binary
 * data. In order to achieve this, a {@link FileBased} object can also implement this interface. It defines an
 * additional {@code read()} method expecting an {@code InputStream} as argument. If the {@code FileHandler} detects
 * that its associated {@code FileBased} object implements this interface, it passes the input stream directly rather
 * than transforming it to a reader.
