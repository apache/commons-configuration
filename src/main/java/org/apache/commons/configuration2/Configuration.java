/**
 * <p>
 * The main Configuration interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface allows accessing and manipulating a configuration object. The major part of the methods defined in
 * this interface deals with accessing properties of various data types. There is a generic {@code getProperty()}
 * method, which returns the value of the queried property in its raw data type. Other getter methods try to convert
 * this raw data type into a specific data type. If this fails, a {@code ConversionException} will be thrown.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For most of the property getter methods an overloaded version exists that allows to specify a default value, which
 * will be returned if the queried property cannot be found in the configuration. The behavior of the methods that do
 * not take a default value in case of a missing property is not defined by this interface and depends on a concrete
 * implementation. E.g. the {@link AbstractConfiguration} class, which is the base class of most configuration
 * implementations provided by this package, per default returns <b>null</b> if a property is not found, but provides
 * the {@link AbstractConfiguration#setThrowExceptionOnMissing(boolean) setThrowExceptionOnMissing()} method, with which
 * it can be configured to throw a {@code NoSuchElementException} exception in that case. (Note that getter methods for
 * primitive types in {@code AbstractConfiguration} always throw an exception for missing properties because there is no
 * way of overloading the return value.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With the {@code addProperty()} and {@code setProperty()} methods new properties can be added to a configuration or
 * the values of properties can be changed. With {@code clearProperty()} a property can be removed. Other methods allow
 * to iterate over the contained properties or to create a subset configuration.
 * </p>
