/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface for looking up variables during interpolation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Objects implementing this interface can be assigned a variable prefix and added to a
 * {@link ConfigurationInterpolator} object. Whenever the {@code ConfigurationInterpolator} encounters a property value
 * referencing a variable, e.g. {@code ${prefix:variableName}}, it extracts the prefix and finds the matching
 * {@code Lookup} object. Then this object is asked to resolve the variable name and provide the corresponding value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface defines a single method for performing variable lookup. It is passed the name of a variable and has to
 * return the corresponding value. It is of course up to a specific implementation how this is done. If the variable
 * name cannot be resolved, an implementation has to return <b>null</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Implementations must be aware that they can be accessed concurrently. This is for instance the case if a
 * configuration object is read by multiple threads or if a {@code Lookup} object is shared by multiple configurations.
 * </p>
