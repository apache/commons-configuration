/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized implementation of the {@code Lookup} interface that allows access to system properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation relies on {@code StrLookup.systemPropertiesLookup()} from the Commons Lang project to resolve
 * system properties. It can be used for referencing system properties in configuration files in an easy way, for
 * instance:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * current.user = ${sys:user.name}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code SystemPropertiesLookup} is one of the standard lookups that is registered per default for each configuration.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 2.0
 * @deprecated Use {@link DefaultLookups#SYSTEM_PROPERTIES}.
