/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface to be implemented by {@code Configuration} implementations which support a special
 * initialization method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is mainly evaluated by <em>configuration builder</em> implementations: If a newly created
 * configuration instance implements this interface, the builder calls the {@code initialize()} method. This gives
 * {@code Configuration} classes the opportunity to perform additional initializations after all properties passed to
 * the builder have been set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another use case for this interface is to perform initializations directly which otherwise would have been done
 * lazily. Lazy initializations can be problematic regarding thread-safety. If in contrast a configuration instance has
 * been fully initialized when it is returned from the builder, it may be used with a {@code NoOpSynchronizer} if it is
 * not modified.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 2.0
