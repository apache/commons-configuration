/**
 * <p>
 * A package containing the implementation of the builder for combined configurations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code CombinedConfigurationBuilder} class defined in this package can create a {@code CombinedConfiguration}
 * object from various configuration sources that are declared in a so-called <em>configuration definition file</em>.
 * This is a convenient means to collect distributed configuration information and access them as a single logic source.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition, the {@code MultiFileConfigurationBuilder} class is located in this package. This builder class selects
 * one file-based configuration out of a set based on dynamic variable substitution. A typical use case would be the
 * definition of multiple configuration files for the different stages of a project: development, integration test,
 * production, etc.
 * </p>
