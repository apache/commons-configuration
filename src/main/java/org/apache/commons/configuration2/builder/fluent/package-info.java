/**
 * <p>
 * This package defines a fluent API for setting up fully configured configuration builders.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * From a client's point of view the most important class in this package is {@code Parameters}. An instance can be used
 * to create various parameters objects defining the settings for a configuration builder. These objects define
 * {@code set} methods allowing the manipulation of all available initialization properties.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Important note</h3>
 * <p>
 * <strong>This package contains a number of interfaces that reflect the initialization parameters available for
 * supported configuration implementations. These interfaces are not intended to be implemented by client code! When new
 * features are added to the represented configuration classes corresponding new methods will be added to them. This can
 * happen even in minor releases.</strong>
