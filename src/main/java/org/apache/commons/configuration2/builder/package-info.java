/**
 * <p>
 * This package contains the implementations of <em>configuration builder</em> classes used to create new
 * {@code Configuration} objects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In <em>Commons Configuration</em>, configuration builders are responsible for the creation and initialization of
 * {@code Configuration} objects. The typical use case is that a builder is created and configured with initialization
 * parameters defining specific settings for the configuration to be created. The builder can then be stored centrally.
 * Each component requiring access to configuration information queries the builder for its managed
 * {@code Configuration} and can read or write properties as its pleasure.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Important note</h3>
 * <p>
 * <strong>This package contains a number of interfaces that reflect the initialization parameters available for
 * supported configuration implementations. These interfaces are not intended to be implemented by client code! When new
 * features are added to the represented configuration classes corresponding new methods will be added to them. This can
 * happen even in minor releases.</strong>
 * </p>
