/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized parameters object for JNDI configurations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the basic properties common to all configuration implementations, a JNDI configuration has some
 * special properties defining the subset of the JNDI tree to be managed. This class provides fluent methods for setting
 * these. The {@code getParameters()} method puts all properties defined by the user in a map from where they can be
 * accessed by a builder for JNDI configurations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread-safe. It is intended that an instance is constructed and initialized by a single thread
 * during configuration of a {@code ConfigurationBuilder}.
