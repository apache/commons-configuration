/**
 * <p>
 * A class representing an event type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The events produced by <em>Commons Configuration</em> all have a specific type. The event type can be used to
 * determine the meaning of a specific event. It also acts as filter criterion when event listeners are registered. The
 * listener is then called only for events of this type or derived types. The events in this library form a natural
 * hierarchy with base types and more specialized types. By specifying an appropriate event type at listener
 * registration time, it can be determined on a fine-granular basis which events are propagated to the listener.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Users familiar with JavaFX probably recognize this approach to event handling. It allows for generic event
 * listener interfaces and a natural selection of events to be processed.
 * </p>

 * @since 2.0
 * @param <T> the event associated with this type
