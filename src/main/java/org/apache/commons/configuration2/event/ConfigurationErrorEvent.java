/**
 * <p>
 * An event class that is used for reporting errors that occurred while processing configuration properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some configuration implementations (e.g. {@link org.apache.commons.configuration2.DatabaseConfiguration} or
 * {@link org.apache.commons.configuration2.JNDIConfiguration} use an underlying storage that can throw an exception on
 * each property access. In earlier versions of this library such exceptions were logged and then silently ignored. This
 * makes it impossible for a client to find out that something went wrong.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To give clients better control over the handling of errors that might occur while interacting with a configuration
 * object, a specialized error event type is introduced. Clients can register as listeners of this event type at a
 * configuration object and are then notified about all internal errors related to the source configuration object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class defines similar properties to the {@link ConfigurationEvent} class. This makes it possible to find out
 * which operation was performed on a configuration causing this error event. In addition, a {@code Throwable} object is
 * available representing the occurred error. Note that depending on the event type and the occurred exception not all
 * of the other properties (e.g. name of the affected property or its value) may be available.
 * </p>
