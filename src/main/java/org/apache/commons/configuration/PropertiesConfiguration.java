/**
 * This is the "classic" Properties loader which loads the values from
 * a single or multiple files (which can be chained with "include =".
 * All given path references are either absolute or relative to the
 * file name supplied in the constructor.
 * <p>
 * In this class, empty PropertyConfigurations can be built, properties
 * added and later saved. include statements are (obviously) not supported
 * if you don't construct a PropertyConfiguration from a file.
 *
 * <p>The properties file syntax is explained here, basically it follows
 * the syntax of the stream parsed by {@link java.util.Properties#load} and
 * adds several useful extensions:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>
 *   Each property has the syntax <code>key &lt;separator> value</code>. The
 *   separators accepted are {@code '='}, {@code ':'} and any white
 *   space character. Examples:
 * <pre>
 *  key1 = value1
 *  key2 : value2
 *  key3   value3</pre>
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   The <i>key</i> may use any character, separators must be escaped:
 * <pre>
 *  key\:foo = bar</pre>
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   <i>value</i> may be separated on different lines if a backslash
 *   is placed at the end of the line that continues below.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   <i>value</i> can contain <em>value delimiters</em> and will then be interpreted
 *   as a list of tokens. Default value delimiter is the comma ','. So the
 *   following property definition
 * <pre>
 *  key = This property, has multiple, values
 * </pre>
 *   will result in a property with three values. You can change the value
 *   delimiter using the {@link AbstractConfiguration#setListDelimiter(char)}
 *   method. Setting the delimiter to 0 will disable value splitting completely.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   Commas in each token are escaped placing a backslash right before
 *   the comma.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   If a <i>key</i> is used more than once, the values are appended
 *   like if they were on the same line separated with commas. <em>Note</em>:
 *   When the configuration file is written back to disk the associated
 *   {@link PropertiesConfigurationLayout} object (see below) will
 *   try to preserve as much of the original format as possible, i.e. properties
 *   with multiple values defined on a single line will also be written back on
 *   a single line, and multiple occurrences of a single key will be written on
 *   multiple lines. If the {@code addProperty()} method was called
 *   multiple times for adding multiple values to a property, these properties
 *   will per default be written on multiple lines in the output file, too.
 *   Some options of the {@code PropertiesConfigurationLayout} class have
 *   influence on that behavior.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   Blank lines and lines starting with character '#' or '!' are skipped.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   If a property is named "include" (or whatever is defined by
 *   setInclude() and getInclude() and the value of that property is
 *   the full path to a file on disk, that file will be included into
 *   the configuration. You can also pull in files relative to the parent
 *   configuration file. So if you have something like the following:
 *
 *   include = additional.properties
 *
 *   Then "additional.properties" is expected to be in the same
 *   directory as the parent configuration file.
 *
 *   The properties in the included file are added to the parent configuration,
 *   they do not replace existing properties with the same key.
 *
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Here is an example of a valid extended properties file:
 *
 * <p><pre>
 *      # lines starting with # are comments
 *
 *      # This is the simplest property
 *      key = value
 *
 *      # A long property may be separated on multiple lines
 *      longvalue = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa \
 *                  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 *
 *      # This is a property with many tokens
 *      tokens_on_a_line = first token, second token
 *
 *      # This sequence generates exactly the same result
 *      tokens_on_multiple_lines = first token
 *      tokens_on_multiple_lines = second token
 *
 *      # commas may be escaped in tokens
 *      commas.escaped = Hi\, what'up?
 *
 *      # properties can reference other properties
 *      base.prop = /base
 *      first.prop = ${base.prop}/first
 *      second.prop = ${first.prop}/second
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A {@code PropertiesConfiguration} object is associated with an
 * instance of the {@link PropertiesConfigurationLayout} class,
 * which is responsible for storing the layout of the parsed properties file
 * (i.e. empty lines, comments, and such things). The {@code getLayout()}
 * method can be used to obtain this layout object. With {@code setLayout()}
 * a new layout object can be set. This should be done before a properties file
 * was loaded.
 * <p><em>Note:</em>Configuration objects of this type can be read concurrently
 * by multiple threads. However if one of these threads modifies the object,
 * synchronization has to be performed manually.
